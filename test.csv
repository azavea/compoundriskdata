        The attack on Tripoli in early 2019 and the blockade of Libya’s major oil ports and terminals in January 2020 have together caused the most serious political, economic, and humanitarian crises Libya has faced since 2011. Libya’s economy was already slowing in 2019 with real GDP growth falling sharply to 2.5% from what seemed a promisingly steady recovery with record growth of 20.8% (on average) in 2017–2018. But, as military confrontation escalated in 2019/2020, oil production decreased—from 1.2 million bpd in December 2019 to 0.1 million bpd in April 2020—choking the country’s economic lifeline.The Libyan economy has now been hit by four, overlapping shocks: an intensifying conflict, which suffocates economic activity; the closure of oil fields, which puts its major income-generating activity largely on hold; decreasing oil prices, which reduce income from surviving oil fields; and the COVID-19 pandemic, which further threatens the economy, with almost 3,500 cases and 75 deaths confirmed by August 2020.  Current Account and Foreign ExchangeIn 2019, Libya’s current account continued to register surpluses for the third year in a row, largely due to the Central Bank of Libya’s (CBL’s) rationing its supply of hard currency for essential imports only, although higher hydrocarbon revenues also contributed to the surplus. Despite this surplus, by the end of 2019, foreign reserves had declined, and the dramatic drop seen since 2014 in foreign direct investments to Libya had also contributed to pressure on foreign reserves. Libya needs political resolution before economic reforms can be implemented to initiate private sector-driven growth and the generation of new jobs—the country’s only path toward sustainable, shared prosperity.In the absence of improvement on the ground, the economic downturn will deepen. Libya’s inability, or curtailed capacity, to produce and export oil might well continue for the rest of 2020 because of the closure of its oil ports and terminals—it is expected to produce a daily average of only 0.17 million barrels of oil for 2020, less than one-seventh of 2019’s production. As a result, GDP is expected to shrink by 41% in 2020. The 2020 budget partially reflects this dire situation with a large, forecasted deficit, the highest in recent years. Likewise, the government’s current account is expected to run astronomical deficits in 2020; consequently, reserves will be further depleted.Given the extreme volatility and unpredictability surrounding recent economic trends, it is not easy to forecast beyond the immediate future. After years of high inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) declined in 2019 as the exchange rate on the parallel market decreased. CPI fell by 2.2% over 2019, compared to a high average of 21.6% inflation over 2016–2018. Inflation picked up in the first two quarters of 2020, reaching 1.3% by April, as the conflict intensified, and shortages too.Libya’s currency continues to suffer on the parallel market because of political uncertainty and macroeconomic instability. The official exchange rate of the Libyan dinar (LYD) against the US dollar stood at 1.37 LYD to US$1 in August 2020, having depreciated by 1.1% compared to August 2018.The parallel exchange market often diverges from official rates but the introduction of the forex fee, while easing access to foreign exchange—especially for essential imports and family allowances—has allowed the steady convergence of the parallel and official, taxed exchange rates, bringing parallel market rates down from LYD/US$9.2 in 2017 to LYD/US$4.0 in 2019. The forex fee was reduced to 163% in August 2019, as the parallel exchange rate moved closer to the official, taxed exchange rate. Prompted by weak macroeconomic fundamentals, the lack of oil exports and decline of global oil prices, and restrictions on the sale of foreign currency imposed by the CBL, the Libyan dinar lost 54% of its value on the parallel market in the first half of 2020, reaching LYD/ US$6.17 in September 2020.Libya Public FinanceThe 2020 budget shows a huge deficit, due to high, rigid expenditure in a context of domestic and global health and economic crises, resulting in shocks to oil supply and demand. On March 20, the GNA adopted a budget for 2020 with an underlying deficit of LYD 29.2 billion (19.3 billion for Tripoli and 9.9 billion for Beyda), representing 90.6% of GDP, the country’s highest deficit ever. The budget estimated LYD 19.2 billion in total revenue for 2020 (59.5% of GDP), almost a third of last year’s share. Only LYD 6 billion is expected to come from the proceeds of oil, less than fifth of what they were in 2019. Projections for non-oil revenue (LYD 3.2 billion) seem overly optimistic given the dire political, social, and economic context and weak administration of customs and tax revenues. Public finances are expected to improve slightly but the inflexibility of current expenditure and volatility of oil revenue place the country’s overall fiscal stance under severe stress.

        The World Bank is committed to supporting Libya with technical assistance and analytical services, as well as Trust Fund and grant financing. With the resumption of armed hostilities, however, the Bank has had to readjust its programs. Its priorities, set out in the Country Engagement Note (CEN) in February 2019, consist of two pillars: Accelerating Economic Recovery and Restoring Basic Service Delivery. The program focuses on actions that will concretely improve lives, with the World Bank Group developing its knowledge base for longer-term engagement with Libya through Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) as well.The Bank Group, in partnership with other donors, will continue to help convene relevant Libyan stakeholders to discuss change and reform, and to seek consensus on how to re-engage and support the restoration of key institutions. The Bank’s work has been selective in content, focusing on building the capacity of public administration in eastern and western Libya. Strong working relationships have been established for this, particularly in public financial management, governance, internal control, Islamic banking, energy, private sector development, and decentralization. This program is funded by the World Bank and Trust Funds.The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank’s private sector arm, is keen to support the private sector in Libya through its investment and advisory services. The IFC was to start creating access to finance for small and medium enterprises, especially those concerned with leasing. It was also working to raise awareness of—and provide capacity building for—the financial sector, as well as for private sector participation in infrastructure development, possibly through Public Private Partnerships. The IFC and World Bank are coordinating to strengthen the financial and private sectors overall: An IFC team went to Tripoli in March 2019 to discuss technical assistance, corporate governance, and other possible areas of assistance.The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has been engaging with Libya since the country’s 2011 revolution and in 2012 provided a guarantee to the TunInvest-AfricInvest Group for a US$8.9 million investment in Jafara Co., a water and juice bottling company based outside Tripoli. The 10-year guarantee is MIGA’s first in Libya and protects the investors against a variety of risks, such as transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance. TunInvest-AfricInvest Group is a private equity house established in Tunisia. MIGA sent a team to Tripoli in April 2019 to explain its role to 45 small and medium-size enterprises at a public forum.

        Sudan is geographically located at the crossroads of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle-East and stretches across the Red Sea. Sudan shares borders with seven countries including Libya and Egypt to the North, Chad to the West, the Central African Republic to the South-West, South Sudan to the South, Ethiopia to the South-East and Eritrea to the East. The White and Blue Niles meet in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, and merge to become the Nile River that flows all the way to the Mediterranean Sea via Egypt. Sudan has a Sahelian belt with the desert in the far north,  fertile land in the Nile valleys, the Gezira and across the rest of the country from Darfur to Kassala via Blue Nile and Kordofan States for farming and livestock herding.For most of its independent history, the country has been beset by internal conflicts that weakened its ability to play a leadership role in the region. Under the terms of a comprehensive peace agreement in 2005, South Sudan seceded in 2011 and became the 54th independent State of Africa.The secession of South Sudan induced multiple economic shocks. The biggest one being the loss of the oil revenue that accounted for more than half of Sudan’s government revenue and 95% of its exports. This has reduced economic growth, and resulted in double-digit consumer price inflation, which, together with increased fuel prices, triggered violent protests in September 2013.The outbreak of civil war in South Sudan damaged both economies depriving Sudan of much needed pipeline revenues. The war in South Sudan also precipitated an increase in Sudan’s already large population of refugees and internally displaced persons with Sudan now serving as a source, destination and transit country for irregular migration, including refugees and asylum-seekers using the East African North-bound migratory route through Libya to Europe. The country hosts an estimated 763 thousand South Sudanese refugees and 159 thousand refugees and asylum seekers from Eritrea, Syria, Yemen, and Chad.

        The twin goals of the World Bank Group (WBG) are to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in Sudan. The World Bank Group’s Board of Executive Directors endorsed a new Country Engagement Note (CEN) for Sudan on October 8, 2020. The CEN aims to support the Government of Sudan’s efforts to reform the economy, build a more equitable social contract, and provide a better future for Sudanese people. The CEN has two focus areas – (i) re-engagement and (ii) contributing to a renewed social contract -- and a cross-cutting theme of promoting inclusion and citizen engagement.While the Bank does not have a formal International Development Association (IDA) program because of the country’s non-accrual status,  the WBG continues to build a dynamic portfolio of projects financed by trust funds, which currently amounts approximately to $472million,by mobilizing third-party financial resources. In November 2017, Sudan released the results of its 2014-2015 poverty survey, putting the nationwide rate of poverty at 36.1%. Given Sudan’s ongoing economic transition, the World Bank’s technical assistance and knowledge resources will be key to guiding authorities in identifying a path toward inclusive and shared growth and poverty reduction. These include a range of reports and analyses, such as Enabling the Business of Agriculture, the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, as well as the 2018 Country Economic Update.Until Sudan clear its arrears and re-engages with IDA, the WBG program will continue to leverage trust funds, partnerships, and the Bank budget to support its technical assistance and projects that help strengthen government delivery systems.  The recently established Sudan Transitional and Recovery Support (STARS) MDTF is designed to raise donor contributions to finance a nationwide cash-transfer program to mitigate the social impact of a package of reforms (or Sudan Family Support Program) .The STARS received about $200 million from the Friends of Sudan as part of several pledges made during the Berlin Conference in June 2020. The funds will support the Transitional Government reforms that are required to stabilize the economy and put the country on a path to arears clearance and debt relief under the Heavily-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. Such reforms, included in an International Monetary Fund Staff-Monitored Program, are expected to be adopted soon.

Efforts to settle conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile remain deadlocked. The Transitional Government has  engaged in peace negotiations with relevant armed groups and signed a peace deal in October 3, 2020 with Sudan Revolution Front (SRF)   expected to put an end to the long-standing conflicts that divert huge resources from much needed social programs and investments in human capital to military buildup.     In addition to the political and economic uncertainty, Sudan, like the rest of the world, has been experiencing the unprecedented social and economic impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The COVID-19 shock is expected to be transitory with potential recovery possible in 2021 but the overall adverse economic impact on Sudan will be substantial. The economic impact of COVID-19 includes the increased price of basic foods, rising unemployment, and falling exports. Restrictions on movement are making the economic situation worse, with commodity prices soaring across the country. According to the International Monetary Fund has already forecasted an overall economic stagnation in 2020 in Sudan.

        The World Bank Group engagement in Sudan is focused on the following projects and activities:Education COVID-19 Response Project: Approved in August 2020, the project aims to support both teachers and students through use of radio, television and student newspapers, and mobilizing teachers to interact with students during social distancing, assessing assignments and reporting the results. The project will support all public schools, benefitting 5.4 million students and their parents, as well as 33,000 teachers. The project also enhances Sudan’s National COVID-19 Response Plan, which includes promoting safe learning at home until schools reopen.Basic Education Recovery Project: Effective July 2013, the project has largely met its objectives to improve the learning environment and increasing the availability of textbooks in primary schools across the targeted areas. The project printed and distributed 22 million textbooks, completed the construction of 1,182 classrooms, and provided grants to 6,399 schools. The total number of students enrolled was 6,020,820, of which 47% were girls.  School enrollment in the 18 sub-national states (where the project constructed classrooms), has increased by 20.4%. A school census was also supported by the project, with various indicators and planned continuity of five years’ follow-up of data in a very simplified manner. That ensured the easiness of data entry, analysis, and reporting. Two rounds of National Learning Assessments have been developed to assess the quality of education within two grades (three and six) in the Basic Education level.Social Protection Safety Net Project: The project aims to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Security and Social Development to transparently and effectively implement the national Cash Transfer Program in correlation with piloting a Productive Safety Net approach for poor households. The project has strengthened the implementation of the ministry’s cash transfer program: 413,914 beneficiaries have been recertified using the mixed method of geographical selection, proxy means testing, and community validation. The Management Information System infrastructure and training to support the recertification process are in place and the data is being verified frequently. In addition, the project targeted and reached 1,000 households, of which 300 are headed by women, and about 400 cash transfer staff and 400 cash transfer beneficiaries received training.Sustainable Natural Resource Management: Financed through the Global Environmental Facility, the project aided in the adoption of sustainable land and water management practices in more than 111,000 hectares of land in different parts of Sudan. In general, more than 47,000 people (of which 45% are women), benefited from the project’s activities. Two thousand farmers have benefitted from the project’s livelihood activities.REDD+ Readiness: The REDD+ readiness project aims at preparing a social and environmental national readiness program for the carbon markets. Phase I achievements between 2014-2018 include technical studies on the \"drivers of deforestation\" and \"land tenure,\" the creation of a benefit sharing mechanism to channel carbon finance to local communities, the development of a national REDD+ Strategy and the development of a national Forest and Rangelands Inventory and Forest Reference Emission Level.Statistical Capacity Building Project: This project aimed to strengthen the capacity of Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) to monitor social indicators, collect pilot household agricultural production statistics, and improve the country’s system of national accounts. Implemented in 2015, the project achieved all of its objectives by the time it closed in November 2018. CBS mapped out available key social indicators, identifying data gaps and drafted a plan to close those gaps. The project also provided training for capacity building of CBS to produce poverty profiles and maps. The project included a pilot agricultural production survey, conducted in one of Sudan’s 18 states. The project supported assessment of the current Systems of National Accounts (SNA) and produced a roadmap for migrating to SNA 2008 from SNA 1968. Phase II of the project started with additional finance to help strengthening the capacity of the Central Bureau of Statistics to improve the quality of household poverty survey data, and to improve the availability and quality of existing administrative data in the education and health sectors. Training on multi-topic household survey design, GIS and mapping, poverty analysis and poverty, econometrics and modeling, have been provided to CBS staff.Sustainable Livelihoods for Displaced and Vulnerable Communities in Eastern Sudan: Phase II (SLDPII) Project: This project aims at strengthening the capacity of local authorities, displaced people, and vulnerable host communities, to plan and implement sustainable livelihoods and natural resource management practices. More than 17,000 Internally Displaced Persons and host community members participated in different activities and 1514 received livelihood grants and skill training. The project implemented 33 small work, trained 304 civil servants and 1,463 beneficiaries.SUDAN COVID-19 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROJECT: The World Bank approved $21.9 million to support the Government of Sudan efforts to contain the COVID -19 Pandemic. This project aims to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness in Sudan. The project agreement was signed in October 2020.Last Updated: Oct 14, 2020"

        Sudan is geographically located at the crossroads of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle-East and stretches across the Red Sea. Sudan shares borders with seven countries including Libya and Egypt to the North, Chad to the West, the Central African Republic to the South-West, South Sudan to the South, Ethiopia to the South-East and Eritrea to the East. The White and Blue Niles meet in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, and merge to become the Nile River that flows all the way to the Mediterranean Sea via Egypt. Sudan has a Sahelian belt with the desert in the far north,  fertile land in the Nile valleys, the Gezira and across the rest of the country from Darfur to Kassala via Blue Nile and Kordofan States for farming and livestock herding.For most of its independent history, the country has been beset by internal conflicts that weakened its ability to play a leadership role in the region. Under the terms of a comprehensive peace agreement in 2005, South Sudan seceded in 2011 and became the 54th independent State of Africa.The secession of South Sudan induced multiple economic shocks. The biggest one being the loss of the oil revenue that accounted for more than half of Sudan’s government revenue and 95% of its exports. This has reduced economic growth, and resulted in double-digit consumer price inflation, which, together with increased fuel prices, triggered violent protests in September 2013.The outbreak of civil war in South Sudan damaged both economies depriving Sudan of much needed pipeline revenues. The war in South Sudan also precipitated an increase in Sudan’s already large population of refugees and internally displaced persons with Sudan now serving as a source, destination and transit country for irregular migration, including refugees and asylum-seekers using the East African North-bound migratory route through Libya to Europe. The country hosts an estimated 763 thousand South Sudanese refugees and 159 thousand refugees and asylum seekers from Eritrea, Syria, Yemen, and Chad. The recent peace accord between the warring parties brokered by Sudan and Ethiopia appears to be holding, but the war damaged oil infrastructure, further eroding revenue availability to Sudan.Following the global oil price slump in 2015/2016, Sudan and South Sudan agreed to lower oil transit fees for South Sudanese oil via Sudan’s pipeline, as it became inefficient to export it. In December 2016, they extended their 2012 agreement on oil for three years on the same terms, except for provisions to adjust transit fees in line with global oil prices.   Continuous food price hikes led to the December 2018 demonstrations which resulted in the removal of president El-Bashir from power in April 2019. This led to the formation of a Transition Government in September 2019. The power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian forces expected to last 39 months, allowed a civilian Prime Minister to lead the government under the authority of a Presidential Sovereign Council to be chaired by the military during the first 21 months followed by a civilian during the remaining 18 months. A transitional legislative assembly is expected to be established soon. On Wednesday July 22, 2020 the Prime Minister appointed 18 civilian Governors thereby achieving a key milestone included in the Constitutional Document of the transition.Armed conflicts in Sudan’s westernmost region of Darfur have subsided but many parts of the region remain precarious because of the proliferation of arms and banditry. Efforts to settle conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile remain deadlocked. The Transitional Government has  engaged in peace negotiations with relevant armed groups and signed a peace deal in October 3, 2020 with Sudan Revolution Front (SRF)   expected to put an end to the long-standing conflicts that divert huge resources from much needed social programs and investments in human capital to military buildup.     In addition to the political and economic uncertainty, Sudan, like the rest of the world, has been experiencing the unprecedented social and economic impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

        In December 2018, the Department for International Development (DfID) increased its contribution to the Multi-Donor trust fund by $9 million, bringing its total contribution to about $20 million over the last six years. This strong partnership with DfID has been key in launching the STARS, funding strategic activities to maintaining a continuous dialogue with the government and other development partners as well as creating the space for the emergence of the core group of Friends of Sudan (FoS) that culminated in the broader International efforts to support the transition in Sudan.During the Berlin Conference in June 2020 foreign donor nations pledged about $1.8 billion to help the transition government fund part of its Humanitarian, Development and Social Impact Mitigation assistance.

        Country ContextCOVID-19 has hit Afghanistan in the midst of a difficult political transition, an intensifying conflict, and significant uncertainty regarding future grant support. Afghanistan’s economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2019, driven mainly by strong agricultural growth following recovery from drought. The economy is estimated to have contracted sharply over the first half of 2020, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Wheat production (mostly in the subsistence sector) has supported continued agricultural growth, but industry and service output have been heavily impacted by lockdowns and border closures.A power-sharing agreement has been signed between the two parties contesting the outcome of the September 2019 presidential elections. Implementation is now underway, that has led to changes in senior staff across key ministries. While the peace talks between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban has started on 12 September 2020, Taliban attacks on Afghan security forces have intensified. The future of international assistance remains in question. The US has substantially reduced troop numbers over 2020, with further reductions likely. Current grant pledges expire at the end of 2020, and international partners are due to consider future aid commitments at an international conference in November. Without progress towards a sustainable peace and commitments to continued grant support from international partners, medium-term prospects appear increasingly grim. Civilian causalities remain high with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan recording 10,392civilian casualties in 2019, and 462,803 Afghans internally displaced due to conflict. The surge in returns by an estimated 1.7 million documented and undocumented Afghan refugees during 2016-2017 remains a pressure on the country’s economy and institutions. Internal displacement and large-scale return within a difficult economic and security context pose risks to welfare for the displaced and host communities.As the international community’s financial commitment to Afghanistan at the October 2016 Brussels Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan is due to expire by the end of 2020, a new pledging conference is planned to be held at the ministerial level in November 2020 hosted by Finland. World Bank Group engagement pursues a programmatic approach to support the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework (ANPDF) that was presented by the Government of Afghanistan at the Brussels Conference. Advisory work and operations focus on macro-fiscal policy and management; finance, private investments and jobs creation; public sector governance and anti-corruption; human capital development and service delivery; citizen engagement and social inclusion, urban development; and infrastructure, connectivity and sustainability.Recent Economic DevelopmentsSubstantial improvements in development outcomes have been observed in Afghanistan since 2001, particularly in expanded access to water, sanitation and electricity, education, and health services.

        Country ContextCOVID-19 has hit Afghanistan in the midst of a difficult political transition, an intensifying conflict, and significant uncertainty regarding future grant support. Afghanistan’s economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2019, driven mainly by strong agricultural growth following recovery from drought. The economy is estimated to have contracted sharply over the first half of 2020, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Wheat production (mostly in the subsistence sector) has supported continued agricultural growth, but industry and service output have been heavily impacted by lockdowns and border closures.A power-sharing agreement has been signed between the two parties contesting the outcome of the September 2019 presidential elections. Implementation is now underway, that has led to changes in senior staff across key ministries. While the peace talks between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban has started on 12 September 2020, Taliban attacks on Afghan security forces have intensified. The future of international assistance remains in question. The US has substantially reduced troop numbers over 2020, with further reductions likely. Current grant pledges expire at the end of 2020, and international partners are due to consider future aid commitments at an international conference in November. Without progress towards a sustainable peace and commitments to continued grant support from international partners, medium-term prospects appear increasingly grim. Civilian causalities remain high with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan recording 10,392civilian casualties in 2019, and 462,803 Afghans internally displaced due to conflict. The surge in returns by an estimated 1.7 million documented and undocumented Afghan refugees during 2016-2017 remains a pressure on the country’s economy and institutions. Internal displacement and large-scale return within a difficult economic and security context pose risks to welfare for the displaced and host communities.As the international community’s financial commitment to Afghanistan at the October 2016 Brussels Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan is due to expire by the end of 2020, a new pledging conference is planned to be held at the ministerial level in November 2020 hosted by Finland.

        The World Bank Group and AfghanistanAfghanistan became a member of the World Bank in 1955. Shortly after the Soviet invasion in 1979, World Bank operations were suspended, although the Bank continued to provide assistance to Afghans through its office in Pakistan.Prior to 1979, the World Bank provided 21 no-interest loans, known as ‘credits’, to Afghanistan across a wide range of areas, including education, roads, and agriculture. Of the original $230 million in credits approved by the International Development Association (IDA), the Bank’s concessionary lending arm, $83 million was disbursed and $147 million was subsequently canceled. Afghanistan repaid $9.2 million to IDA and was up-to-date on debt service payments until June 1992, when it stopped making payments.Operations resumed in May 2002 to help meet the immediate needs of the poorest people while assisting the government in developing the administrative systems required for longer-term nationwide development. Aid has since grown tremendously. To date, the World Bank has provided a total of over 5.1 billion for development and emergency reconstruction projects, and eight budget support operations in Afghanistan. This support comprises over $4.7 billion in grants and $436.4 million in no-interest loans. The Bank has 11 active IDA-only projects ($840 million) and 17 projects jointly funded with the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, with net commitment value of over $1.7 billion from IDA.International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group’s private sector development arm, continues to work with its investment and advisory services partners in Afghanistan. IFC’s current cumulative committed investment portfolio stands at over $300 million and its advisory services portfolio stands at $11.3 million. IFC’s investment portfolio includes investments in the telecommunication sector, agribusiness, and financial markets. The investment pipeline looks promising and includes investments in the power and education sectors.IFC’s advisory services program has been supporting the investment program in access to finance, strengthening horticulture export, access to renewable energy, corporate governance structure enhancement, and investment climate reform interventions.The World Bank Group’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has $116.5 million of gross exposure for two projects in dairy and cashmere production in Afghanistan.The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) was established in 2002 to provide a coordinated financing mechanism for the Government of Afghanistan’s budget and national investment projects. Since its inception, 34 donors have contributed over $12.3 billion to the ARTF, making it the largest single source of on-budget financing for Afghanistan’s development.The ARTF has a three-tier governance framework (Steering Committee, Management Committee, and Administrator), plus three working groups. This sound framework has enabled the ARTF to adapt to changing circumstances and development priorities with consistency and consensus. The World Bank is the Administrator of the trust fund. The Management Committee consists of the World Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, Ministry of Finance, and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan as an observer.

        World Bank Group StrategyThe World Bank Group’s current engagement with Afghanistan is determined by the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), which is closely aligned with the government’s Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework (ANPDF).The World Bank Group’s support to Afghanistan over 2017–2022 aims to help Afghanistan build strong and accountable institutions to deliver services to its citizens and to encourage growth of the private sector. The CPF also aims at supporting economic growth that includes all members of society, with a focus on lagging areas, urban informal settlements, and people driven from their homes by conflict.The World Bank Group strategy aims to help Afghanistan:Build strong and accountable institutions to support the government’s state-building objectives and enable the state to fulfil its core mandate to deliver basic services to its citizens, and create an enabling environment for the private sector;Support inclusive growth, with a focus on lagging areas and urban informal settlements; andDeepen social inclusion through improved human development outcomes and reduced vulnerability among the most underprivileged sections of society, including the large numbers of internally displaced persons and returnees.Over the CPF period, the World Bank expects to provide $250–$300 million in grants annually to Afghanistan through the World Bank Group’s International Development Association, its fund for the poorest countries. Additionally, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund could provide up to $800 million per year in grants, depending on donor commitments. The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank Group’s private sector arm, aims to expand from the current $54 million portfolio to about $80 million. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the Bank Group’s political risk insurance arm, stands ready to provide support with a focus on finance, manufacturing, agribusiness, and infrastructure.

        Building Institutions: The Tackling Afghanistan’s Government HRM and Institutional Reforms is a follow-on the Capacity Building for Results Facility and will assist the Government of Afghanistan to deliver its key policy priorities through merit-based recruitment and administrative reforms in 16 line ministries. The project will support up to a total of 1,100 new civil service positions to enable the ministries to meet their objectives and deliver on their priorities.The Eshteghal Zaiee - Karmondena Project aims to strengthen the enabling environment for economic opportunities in cities where there is a high influx of displaced people. The project will support actions to increase returnees' access to civil documents, provide short-term employment opportunities, improve market enabling infrastructure, and support investor-friendly regulatory reforms.
Education: The Higher Education Development Project (HEDP) aims to increase access to higher education in Afghanistan, as well as improve its quality and relevance. HEDP uses an Investment Project Financing instrument based on the Results-based Financing modality. Enrollment in key priority disciplines (those that contribute to economic and social development) has increased substantially from 64,200 at the project baseline to about 81,900 . The special focus on increasing female enrollment has also paid substantial dividends with female enrollment increasing from 11,400 to approximately 16,900 for the current academic year. The project helps Ministry of Higher Education to develop a policy and by-law for the practice of e-learning. This will support gradual introduction of blended learning, incorporating e-learning into the university curriculum, as well as recognition of blended learning toward program credits.The Skills Development Program project supports the Government of Afghanistan in its strategy to build market relevant vocational and technical skills for economic growth and development. Building on the former Afghanistan Skills Development Project, this program will continue to strengthen the Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutional system, improve performance of TVET schools and institutes, and improve teacher competencies. Under the Afghanistan Second Skills Development Program, 100 national occupational skills standards have been benchmarked to an international level with the support of an international certification agency, and corresponding curricula developed for 15 trades.The project was recently restructured to respond to the closure of TVET schools and institutes due to COVID-19 measures by developing an Alternative Learning Program through distance learning. The restructuring also places strong emphasis on implementation of an action plan for addressing issues associated with Gender-Based Violence.ASPD II is financing an academic partnership contract with Pune University in India. In addition, TVET teachers are pursuing Master’s degrees in one-year technical programs at the Universities of Reva and Sam Higginbottom.Financial Sector: The Access to Finance Project aims to build institutional capacity to improve access to credit of micro, small, and medium enterprises. The Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) has initiated a series of activities, in particular the scaling up of the Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) program. The TUP program has been completed in four provinces (Balkh, Kunar, Laghman, and Takhar) and is ongoing in two more provinces (Kabul and Kandahar).The TUP  has been scaled up to reach close to 4,000 additional households in two more provinces (Parwan and Nangarhar), The two TUP projects are expected to be completed  the end-June 2021.
Health: Bringing most of the efforts in public health service delivery under one umbrella in Afghanistan, the Sehatmandi (Health) Project aims to increase the utilization and quality of health, nutrition, and family planning services across Afghanistan. The project supports implementation of a Basic Package of Health Services and an Essential Package of Hospital Services through contracting arrangements across the country. Sehatmandi also supports efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Public Health at central and provincial levels to effectively carry out its stewardship functions.Health indicators saw an improvement with the support of the System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition Program, the precursor of the Sehatmandi Project. For example, the newborn mortality rate fell 32 percent from 53 to 23 per 1,000 live births from 2003 to 2018; the number of functioning health facilities increased from 496 in 2002 to more than 2,800 in 2018, while the proportion of facilities with female staff increased; and births attended by skilled health personnel among the lowest income quintile increased from 14.9 percent to 58.8 percent.
Horticulture and Livestock: The ARTF supported the National Horticulture and Livestock Project to promote the adoption of improved technologies by target farmers in the horticultural sector and to support the livestock sector, with gradual rollout of farmer-centric agricultural services systems and investment support. The project has financed the establishment of 37,000 hectares (ha) of new pistachio and fruit orchards in 34 provinces. In addition, over 36,000 ha of existing orchards have been rehabilitated and some 143,000 kitchen gardening schemes established.The project has also supported construction of 1,353 small water harvesting structures, improving farmers’ resilience to weather changes by allowing harvest and storage of water during the rainy season and gradual release in the growing period based on crop needs. Over 2015 raisin drying houses has been constructed on a cost-sharing basis to reduce post-harvest losses of grapes and improve the quality of raisins produced.Regarding livestock activities, NHLP continues to focus on key activities, including poultry production and animal health and extension services, while expanding work programs to other areas such as fishery and dairy. To date, the project has supported 205,360 livestock farmers (136,088 women and 69,272 men), clustering them into producers’ groups to benefit from animal production and health services.Irrigation: With over 85 percent of rural population relying on agriculture, irrigation remains a pressing need in rural Afghanistan. The Irrigation Restoration and Development Project (IRDP) envisages support to rehabilitate irrigation systems serving some 215,000 hectares of land and for the design of a limited number of small multi-purpose dams and related works, while establishing hydro-meteorological facilities and services. In the irrigation component, a total of 200 irrigation schemes has been rehabilitated, covering over 284,940 hectares of irrigation command area (compared to the end project target of 215,000 hectares and over 425,000 farmer).In the small dam component, a pre-feasibility review of 22 small dams resulted in a feasibility study being conducted on the six best ranked dams in the northern river basin (which is not on international rivers). In the hydro-met component, installation of 127 hydrological stations and 56 snow and meteorological stations located in various locations on the five river basins in the country is ongoing. In addition, 40 cableway stations for flow measurement at selected hydrology stations have been installed, and the installation of 30 cableways are ongoing.
 Rural Enterprise: Improving access to basic services and facilities through secondary and tertiary roads, the Afghanistan Rural Access Project will increase the number of people living within two kilometers (km) of feeder roads and reduce travel time to essential services. To date, more than 3,270 km of rural roads and related drainage structures have been upgraded or rehabilitated through four projects under these programs financed through IDA, ARTF, and other funds.The Women's Economic Empowerment–Rural Development Project is a follow-on project to the Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Project (AREDP) that aims to increase social and economic empowerment of poor rural women in selected communities. It will engage in 76 districts and 5,000 villages in all 34 provinces across Afghanistan. The project has begun mobilization through new Community Development Councils in the five provinces previously covered under AREDP. Around 440 self-help groups (SHGs) for women are receiving their initial training. The project continues to support business development in the areas previously covered by Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Program.Social Service Delivery: The Citizens’ Charter Afghanistan Project (Citizens’ Charter) is the successor to the highly successful National Solidarity Programme (NSP), which introduced a community-driven development approach toward rural infrastructure and service delivery and reached about 35,000 communities over 14 years. The Citizens’ Charter supports the first phase of the Government of Afghanistan’s 10-year Citizens’ Charter National Program and will target one-third of the country. The Citizens’ Charter aims to improve the delivery of core infrastructure and social services to participating communities through strengthened Community Development Councils (CDCs). These services are part of a minimum service standards package that the government is committed to delivering to the citizens of Afghanistan. Implementation progress includes:In rural areas: Over 11,822 community profiles (CPs) completed; more than 11,400 new CDCs elected; over 11,800 Community Development Plans (CDPs) completed; and more than 12,012 sub-project proposals prepared.In urban areas: Implementation has been rolled out in all 850 communities and Guzars, with a total of 850 community profiles completed and 850 CDCs elected, of which 749 have initiated subprojects. As of May 15, 2020, 506 urban subprojects had been completed and 815 subprojects are ongoing.Results expected under the first phase of the Citizens’ Charter include: (i) 10 million Afghans reached; (ii) 3.4 million people gaining access to clean drinking water; (iii) improvements to quality of service delivery in health, education, rural roads, and electrification; (iv) increase in citizen satisfaction and trust in government; and (v) 35 percent return on investment for infrastructure projects.Urban Development: The Kabul Municipal Development Program increases access to basic urban services in certain residential areas of Kabul City. Over 1.49 million people (about 73 percent women and children) have benefited from the construction of about 770 kilometers of neighborhood roads, 590 kilometers of community drains, and 36 kilometers trunk roads.The Kabul Urban Transport Efficiency Improvement Project aims to improve road conditions and traffic flow on select corridors of Kabul city. To date, nine civil works contracts, totaling 32 kilometers of roadway, have been completed and the roads opened to traffic.

        Mozambique borders Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Eswatini. Its long, Indian Ocean coastline of 2,500 kilometers faces east to Madagascar.  About two-thirds of its population of more than 29 million (2018) live and work in rural areas. It is endowed with ample arable land, water, energy, as well as mineral resources and newly discovered natural gas offshore; three, deep seaports; and a relatively large potential pool of labor. It is also strategically located; four of the six countries it borders are landlocked, and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets. Mozambique’s strong ties to the region’s economic engine, South Africa, underscore the importance of its economic, political, and social development to the stability and growth of Southern Africa as a whole. Political Context The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) and the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) remain the country’s main political forces, followed by the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM). Renamo has maintained a considerable arsenal and military bases after the peace accord of 1992, and ever since the end of the civil war, the country has registered flare-ups of armed confrontations and violence.  A new peace accord was reached in August 2019, and has been violated several times by a Renamo breakaway military faction known as  Military Junta. The new peace deal aimed  at achieving  greater pacification of the country by integrating Renamo residual fighters into the national army, and  dismantling Renamo military bases splattered around the country. Meanwhile, the government is grappling with another so-called Islamic insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado. Initially circumscribed to one locality, the indiscriminate killing of civilians perpetrated by the insurgents has now spread to other districts and towns  in the province. Recently (March 2020) the rebels attacked and occupied  successively the transport hub rural town of Mocimboa da Praia and the town of Quissinga. Recent estimates show the conflict has killed more than 1,000 people and forced 100,000 from their homes. The risk that violence can spread to other areas of the country should not be underestimated. Presidential, legislative, and provincial elections were held across the country on October 15, 2019, completing the country’s sixth successive general elections  since the introduction of multiparty elections in 1994 . The incumbent party, Frelimo, won the presidency and the national parliament in a landslide. Frelimo also secured a majority in all 10 provinces, thus electing governors for each province.  Economic Outlook The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic reached Mozambique at a weak moment in its economic history, as the country attempted to recover from two major shocks: the hidden debt crisis and the devastating effects of cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019.  In 2016, Mozambique’s track record for high growth was disrupted when large, previously unreported external borrowing came to light. The revelation of undisclosed debt dented confidence in the country, increased debt levels, and more than halved the average rate of growth.  In 2019, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused massive damage to infrastructure and livelihoods, further lowering growth and wellbeing of the population. The pandemic presents a further setback on the country’s economic prospects. The pandemic dims the short-term growth prospects of Mozambique. The COVID-19 crisis will have a heavy impact on economic activity as social distancing and travel restrictions (domestically and globally) affect demand for goods and services. At the same time, reduced demand and prices of commodities are slowing the pace of investment in gas and coal, two key industries for Mozambique. With this, growth is expected to decline to 1.3% in 2020, down from a pre-COVID forecast of 4.3%, with significant downside risks. Mozambique is also expected to experience large external and fiscal financing gaps in 2020 and 2021 in a context characterized by exposure to external shocks and limited fiscal space. Development Challenges The country’s main challenges include maintaining the macroeconomic stability considering exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and reestablishing confidence through improved economic governance and increased transparency, including the transparent handling of the hidden debt investigation. Moreover, structural reforms are needed in support of the currently struggling private sector. Another major challenge is diversifying the economy by moving away from the current focus on capital-intensive projects and low-productivity subsistence agriculture, while strengthening the key drivers of inclusion, such as improved quality education and health service delivery, which could in turn improve social indicators.

Frelimo also secured a majority in all 10 provinces, thus electing governors for each province.  Economic Outlook The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic reached Mozambique at a weak moment in its economic history, as the country attempted to recover from two major shocks: the hidden debt crisis and the devastating effects of cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019.  In 2016, Mozambique’s track record for high growth was disrupted when large, previously unreported external borrowing came to light. The revelation of undisclosed debt dented confidence in the country, increased debt levels, and more than halved the average rate of growth.  In 2019, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused massive damage to infrastructure and livelihoods, further lowering growth and wellbeing of the population. The pandemic presents a further setback on the country’s economic prospects. The pandemic dims the short-term growth prospects of Mozambique. The COVID-19 crisis will have a heavy impact on economic activity as social distancing and travel restrictions (domestically and globally) affect demand for goods and services. At the same time, reduced demand and prices of commodities are slowing the pace of investment in gas and coal, two key industries for Mozambique. With this, growth is expected to decline to 1.3% in 2020, down from a pre-COVID forecast of 4.3%, with significant downside risks. Mozambique is also expected to experience large external and fiscal financing gaps in 2020 and 2021 in a context characterized by exposure to external shocks and limited fiscal space. Development Challenges The country’s main challenges include maintaining the macroeconomic stability considering exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and reestablishing confidence through improved economic governance and increased transparency, including the transparent handling of the hidden debt investigation. Moreover, structural reforms are needed in support of the currently struggling private sector. Another major challenge is diversifying the economy by moving away from the current focus on capital-intensive projects and low-productivity subsistence agriculture, while strengthening the key drivers of inclusion, such as improved quality education and health service delivery, which could in turn improve social indicators.

        World Bank Group Engagement in Mozambique Since 1984, the World Bank Group (WBG) has been providing development assistance to Mozambique in accordance with the country’s needs and priorities, from economic stabilization in the 1980s, to post-war reconstruction in the early 1990s, to a comprehensive support strategy in the late 1990s. The current WBG lending portfolio is large and diverse, focusing on the underserved regions of the country. It consists of 27 operations funded by the International Development Association (IDA) with commitments totaling $3.0 billion. The International Finance Corporation committed and outstanding investment portfolio amounts to $176 million with total funds under management of over $15 million in advisory services as of June 30, 2020. There are currently two Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, operations with gross exposure amounts totaling $89.1 million. The focus areas of the current strategy, renamed the Country Partnership Framework (2017-2021) are (a) promoting diversified growth and enhanced productivity, (b) Investing in Human Capital, and (c) Enhancing sustainability and resilience. In alignment with the country’s priorities set forth in the government’s five-year plan, the Bank’s program in Mozambique has expanded its support to the areas of agriculture, rural development, natural resources management, social protection, and disaster risk management. The latter has seen a large increase in response to natural hazards the country faces.   Through the IDA, the Bank is also committed to supporting Mozambique mitigate the economic, fiscal and social impacts of COVID-19 through a Development Policy Operation (DPO) grant. The DPO will support the immediate COVID-19 response and help ease the impact on lives and livelihoods through support to reforms that will aid the recovery and enhance fiscal sustainability.

        Mozambique borders Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Eswatini. Its long, Indian Ocean coastline of 2,500 kilometers faces east to Madagascar.  About two-thirds of its population of more than 29 million (2018) live and work in rural areas. It is endowed with ample arable land, water, energy, as well as mineral resources and newly discovered natural gas offshore; three, deep seaports; and a relatively large potential pool of labor. It is also strategically located; four of the six countries it borders are landlocked, and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets. Mozambique’s strong ties to the region’s economic engine, South Africa, underscore the importance of its economic, political, and social development to the stability and growth of Southern Africa as a whole. Political Context The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) and the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) remain the country’s main political forces, followed by the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM). Renamo has maintained a considerable arsenal and military bases after the peace accord of 1992, and ever since the end of the civil war, the country has registered flare-ups of armed confrontations and violence.  A new peace accord was reached in August 2019, and has been violated several times by a Renamo breakaway military faction known as  Military Junta. The new peace deal aimed  at achieving  greater pacification of the country by integrating Renamo residual fighters into the national army, and  dismantling Renamo military bases splattered around the country. Meanwhile, the government is grappling with another so-called Islamic insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado. Initially circumscribed to one locality, the indiscriminate killing of civilians perpetrated by the insurgents has now spread to other districts and towns  in the province. Recently (March 2020) the rebels attacked and occupied  successively the transport hub rural town of Mocimboa da Praia and the town of Quissinga. Recent estimates show the conflict has killed more than 1,000 people and forced 100,000 from their homes. The risk that violence can spread to other areas of the country should not be underestimated. Presidential, legislative, and provincial elections were held across the country on October 15, 2019, completing the country’s sixth successive general elections  since the introduction of multiparty elections in 1994 .

        Human Capital Placing Results Front and Center in Health and Education Mozambique pioneered an IDA results-based-financing approach in health and education, which served as an incentive for best practices and good governance in both sectors. Thanks to the program, sectors created their own incentives to drive behavior change resulting in tangible improvements in the medicine supply chain and primary school management. The program also contributed to the reduction of medicine stock outs, the improvement of quality of care and treatment outcomes, as well as improved school governance and learning outcomes.Infrastructure Rebuilding Resilient Road Networks In March 2019, the government concluded and inaugurated road networks rebuilt in the province of Gaza, southern Mozambique, following the destruction caused by the 2012 and 2013 floods. The first phase of the Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program restored road connectivity between the various affected areas covering 632.5 km of roads. The $12 million, International Development Agency (IDA)-funded emergency repair operation was completed satisfactorily in 2016. The second phase aimed  for a more in-depth reconstruction of roads and bridges. The project benefited from a total of $102 million of IDA funds in direct investment, and resulted in a total of 198 km of constructed and repaired weather-resilient roads and three new bridges. For example, to increase rainwater flow and reduce overtopping in the rainy season, 115 aqueducts were built, and 15 others repaired along the project's various roads and bridges.Resilience Improving Costal Cities Resilience For years, the coastal city of Beira has been hit by violent storms and recurrent flooding. With poorly planned settlements, inadequate housing and the effects of climate change worsening, large portions of the city’s residents were left vulnerable to climate-related disasters. Through the Mozambique Cities and Climate Change Project, funded by $120 million IDA credit, the city has strengthened its resilience to weather-related hazards. The project upgraded and built 11 km of drainage canals, installation of six flood control stations and the construction of a 170, 000 cubic meter large water retention basin, among other benefits.Protecting Mozambique’s diverse habitatsThrough Bank support for the government’s Mozambique Conversation Areas for Biodiversity and Development Project (MozBio), protection of the country’s diverse habitats has been strengthened, improving the lives of the people who live in and around these areas. The first phase of MozBio (2015-2019) involved more than 20,000 beneficiaries in the Chimanimani, Maputo, Gilé and Quirimbas National Parks, almost half of which are women, in alternative income-generating activities such as honey production and conservation agriculture. The project also piloted the establishment of girls’ clubs and environmental education campaigns in schools, which helped the community to invest in the future by improving environmental awareness and reading and writing skills for youth. Supporting an enabling environment for sustainable fishery Through several initiatives, the Bank-supported SWIOFish Project is helping Tanzania and Mozambique fishing communities increase their fish stocks and restore livelihoods and fisheries. The project also helped significantly reduce the illegal fishing practices such as blast fishing in Tanzania. In Mozambique, the project is providing financing to fishing associations, and helping fishers, particularly women, save their earnings, borrow money and grow their businesses.Agriculture Providing Low-Cost Irrigation for Smallholder FarmersThe Bank is investing $70 million to help small farmers grow and sell rice and vegetables through rehabilitated and expanded irrigation schemes in the central provinces of Manica, Sofala, and Zambézia. More than 6,000 people have directly benefited from the Sustainable Irrigation Development Project (PROIRRI) so far. At completion, the project is expected to ensure irrigation more than 3,000 hectares, of which 1,700 ha are dedicated to rice production, 800 ha for horticulture, and 500 ha for contract production. Energy Supporting Rural Electrification in MozambiqueThe World Bank supports the expansion of photovoltaic solar energy programs, connecting over 500 rural health centers and 300 schools throughout Mozambique. IDA-funded projects which contributed to building new transmission lines and distribution networks, expanding access to electricity. The Bank also supports the use of environmentally-friendly cooking stoves, which brings down pressure on wood fuels, reduces deforestation, and protects women and children against carbon monoxide and volatile particles emanating from coal.

        Niger is a vast country located in the heart of the Sahel region. Its economy is not well diversified and depends primarily on agriculture, which accounts for 40% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Despite significant strides made by Niger over the past decade to reduce the country’s poverty rate, the extreme poverty rate remained very high at 41.4% in 2019, affecting more than 9.5 million people.Niger has, in recent years, also been grappling with a significant influx of refugees fleeing conflicts in the region, particularly in Nigeria and Mali. In April 2019, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) registered 221,671 refugees and 196,717 displaced persons, mainly in Diffa and Maradi.Political ContextThe current president, Mahamadou Issoufou, was reelected to a second term in 2016. The next presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to take place in 2020-2021, preceded by municipal and regional elections. Security conditions have deteriorated in recent years, particularly in the areas bordering Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Mali, where armed groups have established bases and carry out repeated attacks against the security forces and civilians. To date, the government has declared a state of emergency in the Diffa, Tahoua, and Tillabéri regions.In July 2017, the African Development Bank, the European Union, France, Germany, the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank launched the Sahel Alliance to provide an appropriate and coordinated response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since then, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.Economic SituationNiger’s economic growth remained robust at 6.3% in 2019, driven by agriculture, which benefited from favorable weather conditions and investments aimed at boosting agricultural productivity. Economic activity was also driven by the construction of infrastructure for the hosting of the African Union Summit in July 2019 and by major donor-supported projects. These achievements were realized despite a host of obstacles such as low commodity prices, a slowdown in trade triggered by the closure of the border with Nigeria since mid-August 2019, and escalating security challenges. The government prevented the spread of conflicts in Niger's border regions, thereby protecting the main economic activities.Between 2018 and 2019, the fiscal deficit fell from 4.1% to 3.9% of GDP. Higher government spending and lower domestic revenue were offset by an increase in grants.  Tax revenues did not increase substantially, owing primarily to the closure of the border with Nigeria, which resulted in a loss in import duties.  In addition, the sharp decline in domestically financed investment spending and tighter control of current expenditure helped contain public expenditure in 2019. Niger nevertheless remains one of three WAEMU countries that fail to meet WAEMU’s fiscal convergence criterion of 3% of GDP.The current external account deficit (grants included) widened to 19.5% in 2019, driven by high import volumes associated with infrastructure projects. Substantial external capital inflows, concessional loans, and foreign direct investment financed a large share of the current external account deficit.Medium-term OutlookThree factors are likely to undermine Niger’s economic performance:In 2020, the global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) will strain Niger's economy, owing mainly to increased spending on health and social assistance services for vulnerable households aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19. The pandemic will also have an adverse impact on international trade and foreign direct investment channels.  Deteriorating security conditions pose another major risk to economic growth and public finances.Lower oil prices could adversely affect the real sector, public finances, and the balance of payments.Niger also remains vulnerable to climate shocks and fluctuations in global non-oil commodity prices.Last Updated: Apr 17, 2020","

        In September 2017, Niger adopted a new Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES), which the World Bank used as a basis for preparing its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) with Niger for the 2018-2022 period.  The World Bank’s strategy in Niger is based on three pillars: Boosting productivity and income in rural areas; Developing human capital and social protection; and Strengthening governance.The goal is to help preserve and scale up economic and social development in Niger by tackling the obstacles that impede growth and poverty reduction efforts. The World Bank’s strategy also takes into account the risks of fragility, conflict, and violence by supporting Niger's response to the existing crises and helping calm growing tensions. In February 2020, the World Bank was financing 20 national projects and 8 regional projects valued at a total of $2.38 billion (grants and loans included).  These projects support the development of several sectors:water and sanitation (18%);mining and energy (16%);assistance with reforms (15%);agriculture (13%);health and nutrition (10%);social protection and employment (5%);urban development, disaster management, and resilience (9%);poverty and equitable growth (1%);education (4%);finance and competitiveness (2%);environment and natural resources (3%);governance (2%); andtransport and infrastructure (2%).The Niger Refugees and Host Communities Support Project (PARCA), aimed at improving access to basic services and economic opportunities for refugees and host populations, was approved in September 2018. Moreover, Niger benefits from special financing mechanisms from the International Development Association (IDA), which were designed to help low-income countries respond to a significant flow of refugees, as well as additional financing aimed at addressing factors contributing to fragility and violence.International Finance Corporation (IFC)In recent years, IFC has committed to identifying the means to support private sector development in one of the most challenging markets in Africa.In 2016, the Management Advisory Service (MAS) launched an irrigation project in the agrifood sector to spur private investment in irrigated agriculture as part of the Sahel Irrigation Initiative. Efforts were intensified in late 2017 with the organization of the Niger Renaissance Conference in Paris, which garnered large-scale participation by the private sector. Building on this momentum, in early 2019, the MAS team established consultative support for about 20 small and medium enterprises in order to enhance their ability to mobilize funds for local financial intermediaries (including IFC clients).

        The following are some examples of progress made possible by World Bank financing:EducationThe World Bank is providing technical and financial support to the education sector to boost human capital in Niger. These efforts have helped expand access to education, increase pupil retention rates, and improve the quality of the teaching staff as well as learning outcomes in basic education and vocational training. Implementation of the Quality Education Support Project (PAEQ 2015-2019) has helped with the construction of 1,187 classrooms and the education of 59,350 pupils, of whom 29,675 are girls.Through the Skills Development for Growth Project (PRODEC), more than 3,000 out-of-school young people were enrolled in the dual apprenticeship program, 31% of whom are female. According to a PRODEC assessment finalized in late 2018, the entrepreneurship training offered new professional opportunities to 71.5% of beneficiaries.Social Safety NetsThe objective of the Safety Net Project for Niger is to establish and support an effective safety net system that will help increase access for poor people and those vulnerable to food insecurity to cash transfer and “cash for work” programs. Over 1 million people in total have benefited directly from the project, which has resulted in several achievements:Cash transfers were implemented in all regions of the country. In total, 98,747 households benefited from cash transfers, for an overall total of $47 million;The establishment of \"cash for work\" activities helped support 50,256 households to the tune of $12 million. More than 700 community assets were also built or restored;Transfers were implemented in response to the shocks for approximately 5,000 households in the regions of Diffa and Agadez;Support and outreach measures were implemented to promote behavior change among 87,331 households, as well as productive support measures for more than 16,700 households.Water, hygiene, sanitation (WASH)In June 2016, financing totaling $35 million for the Urban Water and Sanitation Project (PEAMU) helped more than 893,500 people gain access to potable water, 52% of whom were women. Moreover, 67,560 pupils of the 86,940 targeted by the project had access to an improved sanitation system in their schools, and 708 latrines were constructed for teachers.The major infrastructure project financed under this project was the construction of a waste sludge treatment plant in Niamey, which was launched in December 2018. A second waste sludge treatment plant was also built in Niamey. The use of these plants, which alone will receive almost half of the wastewater from households, will help improve living conditions and the environment in the capital.

        Algeria is having to navigate a recession within the constraints of strict lockdown measures, introduced to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and a significant fall in the price and volume of international hydrocarbon exports in the first half of 2020. While the lockdown has helped reduce the spread of the virus, labor-intensive sectors—including services and construction, which remain largely inside the informal economy—have been deeply affected, resulting in many jobs being lost on a temporary or permanent basis, and many more jobs placed at risk.This follows a year, 2019, marked by social mobilization and a political transition, in which the Algerian economy was modified by contracting hydrocarbon output along with more modest contributions to growth from services, agriculture, and construction. Algeria’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 0.8% in 2019—down from 1.2% in 2018—with a 2.4% expansion in non-hydrocarbons largely offset by a 4.9% decline in hydrocarbons.

Algeria’s twin deficits, dependent on hydrocarbon revenues, remained significant: The overall budget deficit deteriorated to -9.6% of GDP in 2019 as a result of a decline in hydrocarbon revenue and a rise in capital expenditure, while the current account deficit remained relatively unchanged at -10% of GDP. Algeria’s foreign currency reserves steadily declined, reaching 13.6 months of imports at end-2019.Algeria’s long-term economic growth is slowing down, driven by a shrinking hydrocarbon sector, an overblown public-led model of growth, and a private sector struggling to take over as the new driver of growth. The hydrocarbon industry, which accounts for 19.5% of GDP, 41% of budget revenues, and 94% of product exports is undergoing structural decline. Algeria, like other oil-exporting countries across the MENA region, will need to shift towards a more diversified economic model if it wants to sustain higher economic growth rates and job creation. The decline in hydrocarbon revenues means that its current level of public spending can no longer be sustained. Policies to diversify the economy and increase budget revenues need to be complemented by measures to improve the efficiency and fairness of public spending to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population. The success of the National Socio-economic Recovery Plan under preparation will hinge on its ability to restore macroeconomic stability and enact decisive policies to support private sector development, while continuing to support the delivery of critical services.In the past two decades, the hydrocarbon boom has allowed Algeria to make advances in economic and human development. The country cleared its external debt, invested in infrastructure projects, and implemented redistributive social policies that contributed to a significant reduction in poverty, as well as large improvements in Human Development Indicators. Algeria met the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and is considered to have achieved universal primary education with a 97% primary net enrollment rate in 2015 (with gender parity); it also has increased its higher education enrollment rates. The quality of education needs to improve, however, with Algeria ranking 71 out of 72 for the performance of its student cohort of 15-year-olds in sciences, mathematics, and reading in the 2015 PISA assessment. According to the World Bank Group’s 2020 Human Capital Index (HCI)  providing a pre-pandemic baseline on the health and education of children, between 2010 and 2020 the HCI value for Algeria has remained relatively unchanged, at 0.53. This is higher than average for lower-middle-income countries, but lower than average for the Middle East and North Africa region.

        Algeria is having to navigate a recession within the constraints of strict lockdown measures, introduced to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and a significant fall in the price and volume of international hydrocarbon exports in the first half of 2020. While the lockdown has helped reduce the spread of the virus, labor-intensive sectors—including services and construction, which remain largely inside the informal economy—have been deeply affected, resulting in many jobs being lost on a temporary or permanent basis, and many more jobs placed at risk.This follows a year, 2019, marked by social mobilization and a political transition, in which the Algerian economy was modified by contracting hydrocarbon output along with more modest contributions to growth from services, agriculture, and construction.

        Since 2010, the strategic partnership framework between the World Bank and Algeria has been based on advisory services (Reimbursable Advisory Services, RAS), which are offered in response to requests for support with development priorities. This portfolio is composed of four technical assistance projects. The programs seek to: boost inclusive growth through economic diversification; promote sustainable development and reduce territorial disparities; and strengthen the economic planning, monitoring, and evaluation of institutions. The activities involved relate to export value chains and public finance, as well as improvements in the business environment and the Doing Business indicators. Reimbursable advisory services are complemented by several types of analytical and technical assistance work financed by the World Bank budget and other resources. Reimbursable services being provided to the Crédit Populaire d’Algérie, Algeria’s leading State-owned bank, are the most substantive ever offered by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

        World Bank Group (WBG) Assistance to EthiopiaThe Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY18-FY22 builds on the progress achieved by Ethiopia during the past five years. The CPF was developed after intensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders to gain a broad-based perspective on the WBG’s performance and development priorities. The CPF is a result-based strategy, firmly anchored in the government’s Second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTPII).The CPF is designed to assist Ethiopia in forging a more inclusive and sustainable growth path. Particularly, it supports a more spatially inclusive approach to development, one that leverages national programs to provide quality services to all areas. The CPF is helping to promote structural and economic transformation through increased productivity in rural and urban areas by focusing on basic education, access to markets, and job opportunities for youth. It is also helping to build resilience and inclusiveness (including gender equality) by improving safety nets, investing in productive landscapes, and focusing on the Early Years agenda.The CPF also supports institutional accountability and assists in combating corruption by focusing on improving governance and promoting social accountability. The private sector is expected to be a key contributor to Ethiopia’s future development, and the CPF envisages prominent roles for the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the WBG institutions that focus exclusively on it.

        As of August 12, 2020, the World Bank’s portfolio consists of 37 lending operations with $11.64 billion in commitments complemented by $1.1billion in trust funds. The portfolio includes financing for national programs on agriculture, sustainable land management, basic service delivery (including health, education, and water and sanitation), as well as support in the energy, transportation, trade logistics, and financial sectors.Development policy operations in FY19-20 total nearly $2 billion in support of critical reforms for power sector sustainability, improving the investment climate, providing for the development of public-private partnerships  and developing the financial sector, as well as improving transparency and accountability. This includes a $250 million operation supporting these reforms while helping to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, which was approved and disbursed in June 2020.The International Development Association (IDA) also provides analytics and advisory services to provide support for evidence-based decision-making and stronger implementation on a wide range of development issues. IDA is Ethiopia’s largest provider of official development assistance. IDA has committed more than $25 billion to nearly 100 projects in Ethiopia since 1991, most notably for the Growth and Competitiveness Programmatic Development Policy, the Enhancing Shared Prosperity through Equitable Services program, productive safety net, Urban Institutional and Infrastructure Development Program as well as energy and road sector development projects. EducationIDA’s support for the education sector—including through the General Education Quality Improvement Program and the Enhancing Shared Prosperity through Equitable Services program—has helped Ethiopia expand access to quality primary education over the last nine years. There has been significant expansion of the general education system, increasing from 7.1 million learners in 2000 to 26 million in 2019. As a result, net enrollment rates in primary education and secondary education have increased to about 90 and 25% respectively. Through the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), the Bank is working to improve the quality of and equitable access to education to address issues including high dropout rates and low learning outcomes, especially for girls.Water and SanitationIDA’s investment in Ethiopia’s water supply and sanitation sector has helped the country make significant progress in improving services in the past 10 years. More than  52 million people in Ethiopia now live within 1.5 kilometers of an improved drinking water source compared with only six million people in 1990. Over the same period, rates of open defecation fell by 63%, which was the largest decrease observed in the world. About 67 million people gained access to a latrine, at an average rate of 2.6 million people per year. Under the Country Partnership Framework, which guides the World Bank’s engagement in Ethiopia, the Bank continues to support the government’s  goal to provide 100% national potable water supply coverage by 2020.RoadsIDA has invested more than $2 billion since 1991 to address the country’s infrastructure gap, partly through the Road Sector Development Program (RSDP). IDA helped build capacity and establish a dedicated road fund for financing maintenance. Working in partnership with other donors, including the European Commission, Germany, Japan, Nordic countries and the United Kingdom, IDA helped increase both the size and quality of Ethiopia’s road network from under 20,000 km in 1991 to over 138,000 km in 2019. Under the CPF, the World Bank continues to support improvements in transport infrastructure and road connectivity to reduce travel times and improve connectivity between markets and secondary cities.

        Ethiopia’s location gives it strategic dominance as a jumping off point in the Horn of Africa, close to the Middle East and its markets. Ethiopia is landlocked, bordering Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, and Sudan, and has been using neighboring Djibouti's main port for the last two decades.

        Several donors are active in Ethiopia, with external aid of $4.9 billion in 2018. Both the government and the majority of international partners are keen to deepen the harmonization process in the spirit of the Paris Declaration (2005) and Accra Agenda for Action (2008). Ethiopia is a pilot country for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Assistance Committee harmonization agenda, and for the European Union’s initiative on donor division of labor. Partners are currently considering how to build on this progress in light of the Accra Agenda. The World Bank Group (WBG), with the United Nations Development Programme and one bilateral donor, is one of the rotating co-chairs of the Development Assistance Group (DAG), the main forum for donor coordination in Ethiopia. Through DAG there are efforts to make progress on the implementation of commitments in the Paris and Accra Declarations, including joint economic and sector work (much of the WBG’s major analytical work has already been prepared with its partners) and joint missions. Much of the collective effort is focused on furthering harmonization through major multi-donor programs and policy areas of importance.The WBG has taken the lead in developing a set of multi-donor programs to reduce transaction costs, aligning support with the country’s decentralized model, and enhancing the predictability of aid. These instruments allow for large-scale leveraging of International Development Association (IDA) support. Such approaches are used in the Enhancing Shared Prosperity through Equitable Services, the Productive Safety Nets Program 4; the Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene Universal Access Program, the Sustainable Land Management Project II, and the Agricultural Growth Program II. The launch of the Expressway Development Support Project (EDSP) marked a historic moment in the WBG’s partnership with Ethiopia, as it is the first project co-financed with China EXIM Bank and South Korea EXIM Bank. The project brings together traditional and non-traditional development partners to work on a single project, with standardized design, safeguards, and joint-supervision.

        Iraq is in a fragile situation. The drop in oil prices and COVID-19 pandemic are placing unprecedented strains on its economy. A precarious political situation, weak healthcare system, ineffective social safety nets, rampant corruption, and dilapidated service delivery, all amplify this fragility and have fueled large-scale protests across the country. While the new Government of Iraq (GoI) has been asserting its grip on security and illegal weapons and, in response to the protests, has announced a date for new parliamentary elections, it has been struggling to deal with the economic challenges it faces. Pre-existing conditions—its heavy dependence on oil, dominance of the state in economic activities, and a poor business environment—as well as budget rigidities, have combined to limit the government’s capacity to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and to offer a stimulus package to restart the economy. Faced with this multifaceted crisis, growth is expected to contract by 9.5% in 2020, Iraq’s worst annual performance since 2003. Oil-GDP is expected to contract by 12% (capped by the OPEC+ agreement) while non-oil-GDP is expected to contract by 5% with sectors like religious tourism affected by COVID-19 measures. Subdued domestic demand and the depreciation of the currencies of Iraq’s main trading partners have kept inflation in check at less than 1% in 2020.The key challenge for Iraq will be to navigate this multi-dimensional crisis. The OPEC+ agreement, coupled with global recession, mean its prospects are on the downside, underscoring the importance of creating fiscal space for human capital, economic diversification, and job creation. Even with a recovery in oil prices, Iraq will need to undertake many reforms to rebuild fiscal space by cutting distortionary and inefficient spending and strengthening the medium-term orientation of macroeconomic policies. A failure to narrow the twin deficits and a rapid build-up in government debt would divert more resources away from productive investment and further reduce foreign exchange reserves and the economy’s resilience to shocks. As such, the outlook for Iraq will depend on global oil markets, the capacity of the Iraqi healthcare system to respond to COVID-19, and its economic reform process. If conditions ease, growth is projected to gradually return to 2 to 7.3% in 2021–2022, with the non-oil economy projected to bounce back to an average of 4%. In the absence of public wage bill and pension reforms, the fiscal deficit is projected to remain sizeable, averaging 12% of GDP in 2021–2022 amidst a modest recovery in oil prices. Consequently, Iraq’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain elevated.The current crises are likely to worsen the welfare of Iraqi households. After years of conflict and displacement, many are already vulnerable, and the pandemic will further test their resilience. While the disruption in supply chains will increase basic prices, household labor and non-labor incomes are likely to decrease due to the economic slowdown and reduced remittances. Many households, especially those in the informal private sector, may lose all their income, compelling them to exhaust their savings and resort to other coping mechanisms. In the absence of a significant government response, these short-term effects, coupled with reduced access to education, healthcare, and other services will have lasting impacts on the ability of households either to escape poverty or remain above it. Projections suggest that poverty could increase by 7 to 14 percentage points, meaning that 2.7 to 5.5 million more Iraqis could become poor due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the existing 6.9 million poor, pre-COVID.

The World Bank Group also works closely with partners from the international community to support the implementation of economic reforms designed to strengthen the country’s long-term economy. In October 2019, the GoI signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the World Bank Group to cooperate and further their engagement in addressing impediments for cross-cutting and sector-specific obstacles standing in the way of private sector-led diversification, including (i) fiscal stability, economic governance, the financial sector, and the business environment; and in (ii) agriculture, gas, electricity, social protection and labor systems. This MOU became a white paper the Bank shared with the GOI.The Bank Group is developing a five-year Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Iraq in two phases with its overall objective a better future for Iraqi youth. It aims to guide Iraq’s transition toward a more resilient, inclusive economy, support engagement to help de-risk the private sector, and mobilize finance for development. The CPF is organized around three pillars: (i) improved governance, transparency, and accountability, (ii) strengthened human capital, and; (iii) enhanced infrastructure and public service delivery. It encompasses citizen engagement, gender inclusion and climate change. The CPF is aligned with Iraq’s five-year National Development Plan.The World Bank released Iraq’s Country Economic Memorandum on September 30, 2020. The CEM analyzes constraints and drivers of economic growth and makes actionable policy recommendations for a more diverse and inclusive growth model. The Bank is finalizing the Iraq Human Development Public Expenditure Review Report, which offers evidence‐based policy recommendations to inform urgently needed reforms to spur human capital development. The report specifically examines three vital sectors: health, education, and the pension system.World BankThe following have been the main areas of the World Bank’s engagement in Iraq since 2015:Fiscal StabilizationIn December 2015, the World Bank approved a US$1.2 billion Development Policy Financing loan (DPF) and, in December 2016, another US$1.44 billion DPF loan to help Iraq weather its fiscal crisis and move ahead with reforms in three areas: the management of public finances; a more stable and sustainable energy supply; and more efficient, transparent state-owned enterprises.A Multi-Donor Trust Fund: Iraq Reform, Recovery and Reconstruction Fund (I3RF)With the GoI, United Kingdom, and Germany as founding partners, the World Bank has established a multi-donor platform, the Iraq Reform, Recovery and Reconstruction Fund, to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of public investment in recovery and reconstruction and support reforms promoting private-sector led growth. The Trust Fund is also a platform for coordination and dialogue. Its activities will be carried out by both the GoI and World Bank in: (i) socio-economic recovery and reconstruction; (ii) economic diversification and private sector-led growth; and (iii) strengthening coordination and program support. Canada has recently contributed as a partner.Modernization of Public Financial Management Systems (PFM)Financed with an IBRD loan of US$41.5 million and under implementation (from 2017 to 2021) in the federal Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning and the KRG Ministry of Planning, the project aims to improve the transparency and management of financial information, cash, and public investment, and the modernization of public procurement at selected federal and governorate agencies. The World Bank Emergency Response includes:Emergency Operations for Development (EODP)In July 2015, a US$350 million financial package was approved by the World Bank to support the reconstruction of infrastructure and the restoration of public services, including health, electricity, water, transport, education, and agriculture in and around targeted municipal areas then newly retaken from ISIS. As a response to the enormous reconstruction needs in Mosul and other liberated areas, the World Bank’s Board of Directors approved Additional Financing of US$400 million in 2017.Iraq Emergency Social Stabilization and Resilience Project (ESSRP)A US$200 million loan aims to increase: livelihood opportunities in areas recaptured from ISIS; access to psychosocial services; and the strengthening of systems needed to expand the provision of social safety nets. The project includes cash for work, social support, livelihood opportunities, and resilient social safety nets.Other World Bank-financed projects include:Transport Corridors ProjectA US$355 million project to improve connectivity and safety on selected road sections of Expressway-1, a 1,200 km-long highway serving traffic along Iraq’s East-West and South-North Corridors linking Um Qasr in the south with Jordan and Syria via Baghdad; and the North–South trade corridor in Duhok governorate towards the Ibrahim El-Khalil border crossing with Turkey.Baghdad Water and Sewerage ImprovementA US$210 million project to improve the quality of drinking water and wastewater services in Baghdad, with the objectives of improving utility management and creating an enabling environment. The project aims at institutional strengthening for integrated urban water management and utility management, and to create an enabling environment for private sector management and investment in drinking water supplies and wastewater infrastructure.Social Fund for DevelopmentThe US$300 million Community Driven Development project, launched in 2019 to improve access to basic services and increase short-term employment opportunities, has seen good progress in the first three governorates it targeted first—Salahuddin, Muthanna, and Duhok. The project is planning to work with communities in all 18 governorates of Iraq over a 5-year period. Basra Electricity Dissemination and Development Project (EDDP)A subnational project of US$200 million that could foster increased private sector participation in the medium-term, this project works to improve the reliability and operational efficiency of electrical services in Basra Governorate. In doing so, it supports broader objectives of decentralizing services. Promoting the Inclusion of Conflict-Affected Iraqi YouthA recipient-executed grant to promote the social and economic inclusion of at least 3,000 conflict-affected Iraqi youth (ages 15 to 29) through entrepreneurship and youth-led community development activities. International Finance Corporation (IFC) IFC has been actively investing in Iraq over the last 15 years, with a focus on mobilizing foreign direct investment and supporting the local private sector. IFC’s cumulative, long-term financing in Iraq—including mobilization by other financiers—has exceeded $1 billion since 2005, with its investments diversified both geographically and across sectors to include power, telecoms, manufacturing, agribusiness, logistics, tourism, and banking. In FY2020 IFC supported investments in the Iraqi healthcare sector, investing in a new hospital, as well as in banking to help increase access to finance for smaller businesses.IFC is collaborating closely with the World Bank to support economic diversification in private sector development, crowding-in private investment and applying the Cascade principle across strategic areas. Besides energy and transport, the financial sector has been identified as a focus. IFC is also working with other development partners through the Prospects Partnership to support entrepreneurship in Iraq, helping Foreign Displaced Persons and Internally Displaced Persons and vulnerable host communities in the country.Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) MIGA’s outstanding gross exposure in Iraq stood at US$8 million as of September 21, 2020. MIGA signed its first contract of guarantees in Iraq in FY2011 for a project that supported a Turkish investment in a water bottling plant in Baghdad. In FY2014, MIGA provided another guarantee for a project in the telecom sector in the Kurdistan autonomous region of Iraq, and in FY2015 it supported a port logistics project in Umm Qasr. Most recently, in FY2019, MIGA issued guarantees in favor of a Lebanese financial institution with operations in Iraq. The Bank, IFC, and MIGA are working closely to identify opportunities to support FDI in Iraq, especially in the energy, transport, and financial sectors.

        Iraq is in a fragile situation. The drop in oil prices and COVID-19 pandemic are placing unprecedented strains on its economy. A precarious political situation, weak healthcare system, ineffective social safety nets, rampant corruption, and dilapidated service delivery, all amplify this fragility and have fueled large-scale protests across the country. While the new Government of Iraq (GoI) has been asserting its grip on security and illegal weapons and, in response to the protests, has announced a date for new parliamentary elections, it has been struggling to deal with the economic challenges it faces. Pre-existing conditions—its heavy dependence on oil, dominance of the state in economic activities, and a poor business environment—as well as budget rigidities, have combined to limit the government’s capacity to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and to offer a stimulus package to restart the economy. Faced with this multifaceted crisis, growth is expected to contract by 9.5% in 2020, Iraq’s worst annual performance since 2003. Oil-GDP is expected to contract by 12% (capped by the OPEC+ agreement) while non-oil-GDP is expected to contract by 5% with sectors like religious tourism affected by COVID-19 measures. Subdued domestic demand and the depreciation of the currencies of Iraq’s main trading partners have kept inflation in check at less than 1% in 2020.The key challenge for Iraq will be to navigate this multi-dimensional crisis. The OPEC+ agreement, coupled with global recession, mean its prospects are on the downside, underscoring the importance of creating fiscal space for human capital, economic diversification, and job creation. Even with a recovery in oil prices, Iraq will need to undertake many reforms to rebuild fiscal space by cutting distortionary and inefficient spending and strengthening the medium-term orientation of macroeconomic policies. A failure to narrow the twin deficits and a rapid build-up in government debt would divert more resources away from productive investment and further reduce foreign exchange reserves and the economy’s resilience to shocks. As such, the outlook for Iraq will depend on global oil markets, the capacity of the Iraqi healthcare system to respond to COVID-19, and its economic reform process. If conditions ease, growth is projected to gradually return to 2 to 7.3% in 2021–2022, with the non-oil economy projected to bounce back to an average of 4%. In the absence of public wage bill and pension reforms, the fiscal deficit is projected to remain sizeable, averaging 12% of GDP in 2021–2022 amidst a modest recovery in oil prices. Consequently, Iraq’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain elevated.The current crises are likely to worsen the welfare of Iraqi households. After years of conflict and displacement, many are already vulnerable, and the pandemic will further test their resilience. While the disruption in supply chains will increase basic prices, household labor and non-labor incomes are likely to decrease due to the economic slowdown and reduced remittances. Many households, especially those in the informal private sector, may lose all their income, compelling them to exhaust their savings and resort to other coping mechanisms. In the absence of a significant government response, these short-term effects, coupled with reduced access to education, healthcare, and other services will have lasting impacts on the ability of households either to escape poverty or remain above it. Projections suggest that poverty could increase by 7 to 14 percentage points, meaning that 2.7 to 5.5 million more Iraqis could become poor due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the existing 6.9 million poor, pre-COVID.

        Restoration of basic services in the recaptured areas under the Emergency Operation for Development Project (EODP) (US$ 750 million)Beneficiaries: Over 5 million Iraqis living in 5 governorates—Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninawa, and Salah Ad-Din—live within the areas reached by the reconstruction program to date;Jobs: over 500,000 workdays of temporary employment have been generated to skilled and unskilled Iraqis;Health Services: 14 mobile clinics and 39 ambulances have been supplied to improve access to essential, primary health care services in several cities and towns in Diyala and Salah Ad-Din governorates;Municipal Services: About 1 million people in 18 communities have regained access to municipal services since damaged municipal equipment was replaced, including water purification and wastewater treatment plants, and water and sewage pipes;Transport Connectivity: 25 bridges and the rehabilitation of 400km of damaged roads, giving access to markets, jobs, and services.Electricity Connectivity: Over 500,000 people have seen their electricity reinstated since the replacement of damaged substations, generators, transformers, cables, and so on. Restoring Basic Infrastructure: By working with 4 subnational governments toward restoring and rehabilitating civic centers and marketplaces in a number of cities in Anbar, Diyala, Ninawa, and Salah Ad-Din governorates. Improve Road Transport Connectivity and Safety under the Transport Corridors Project (US$355 million)Beneficiaries: Iraqis living in the Southern Governorates and the trading community;Jobs: Over 700,000 workdays of temporary employment have been generated to skilled and unskilled Iraqis. Expressway No. 1,200 km of road have been rehabilitated in Southern Iraq, and 20 km of green field link along the economic corridor in the Kurdistan region of Iraq has been constructed, facilitating the movement of goods and trade and people’s access to services and jobs.Road Safety: Traffic safety has been substantially improved along these corridors, reducing traffic-related fatalities from an estimated 450 to 25 during the last 4.5 years along the 200km segment of Expressway No. 1, and from 72 fatalities along the Kurdistan region of Iraq corridor to 0 fatalities.Social Protection and Jobs SupportWith a large, active portfolio in Iraq worth over US$500 million, the SPJ program seeks to: (i) provide income support and increased access to sustainable livelihoods for the poorest and most vulnerable Iraqis; (ii) deliver community-driven development services; and (iii) establish the main building blocks of a resilient social protection system. To date, the Social Fund for Development (SFD) is financing the implementation of 62 sub-projects in 3 targeted governorates—Muthanna, Salahuddin, and Duhok)—enabling about 63,000 households (or approximately 315,000 individuals) in these governorates to have increased access to basic services, and providing short-term employment to over 1,000 Iraqis. The SFD is being scaled up in the first 3 governorates as well as an additional 8, and is expected to finance an additional 70 sub-projects, thus enabling another 75,000 households (or approximately 375,000 individuals) to have increased access to basic services, and an additional 1,260 Iraqis to have short-term employment.

        The Republic of South Sudan became the world’s newest nation and Africa’s 55th country on July 9, 2011. Renewed conflicts in December 2013 and July 2016 have undermined the development gains achieved since independence and worsened the humanitarian situation. The gradual implementation of the September 2018 peace agreement including the formation of the unity government in February 2020 and agreement on number of states provided for a positive economic outlook earlier in 2020. Nonetheless, subsequent shocks that included flooding in parts of the country, locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic, and lower oil prices have changed the outlook over a relatively short time period and exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and humanitarian needs.South Sudan remains in a serious humanitarian crisis due to the cumulative effects of years of conflict which has destroyed people’s livelihoods. Extreme levels of acute food insecurity persist across the country and nearly 7.5 million (more than half of the population) in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in 2020. Almost 4 million people remain displaced by the humanitarian crisis, with nearly 1.6 million people displaced internally and some 2.26 million refugees in six neighboring countries. Women and children continue to be the most affected. A recent upsurge in ethnically motivated violence in parts of the country may exacerbate the humanitarian situation on the ground.South Sudan is one of the most oil-dependent countries in the world, with oil accounting for almost the totality of exports, 90% of revenue, and more than one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP). The country’s GDP per capita in 2014 was $1,111 dropping to less than $200 in 2017. Outside the oil sector, livelihoods are concentrated in low productive, unpaid agriculture and pastoralists work.Coupled with economic mismanagement, many years of conflict have eroded the productive capacity of the country. As recent events have shown, the South Sudan economy is especially vulnerable to weather, oil price, and conflict related shocks. The economy had showed signs of recovery in FY 2018/19 with an estimated growth rate of 3.2% - the first positive GDP growth in five years. While the economy was expected to build on this positive turn and continue on a gradual growth trajectory, FY20 economic growth is estimated at -4.3%, once again highlighting the unique vulnerabilities of South Sudan. Inflation averaged 87% during the first nine months of FY2019/20 higher than during FY2018/19. The gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel market rate remains high and was estimated at 103% in June 2020.South Sudan continues to under-invest in sectors that would have the largest knock-on effect on poverty reduction and building resilience, with expenditures skewed toward defense and security at the expense of service delivery. Consequently, poverty levels are expected to remain extremely high on the back of severe food insecurity and limited access to basic services across the country. About 82% of the population in South Sudan is poor according to the most recent estimates, based on the $1.90 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) poverty line.The main priority for the government is to address the underlying causes of the conflict and restore peace and stability across the country in line with the provisions in the R-ARCSS. To ensure economic recovery, the government will need to implement comprehensive macroeconomic reforms, including measures to reduce inflation, address foreign exchange distortions, as well as longer term action to diversify the economy. Strengthening Public Financial Management systems and pursuing a people centered public investment program will support resilience, reduce poverty, build a stock of human capital, and secure the future.

Almost 4 million people remain displaced by the humanitarian crisis, with nearly 1.6 million people displaced internally and some 2.26 million refugees in six neighboring countries. Women and children continue to be the most affected. A recent upsurge in ethnically motivated violence in parts of the country may exacerbate the humanitarian situation on the ground.South Sudan is one of the most oil-dependent countries in the world, with oil accounting for almost the totality of exports, 90% of revenue, and more than one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP). The country’s GDP per capita in 2014 was $1,111 dropping to less than $200 in 2017. Outside the oil sector, livelihoods are concentrated in low productive, unpaid agriculture and pastoralists work.Coupled with economic mismanagement, many years of conflict have eroded the productive capacity of the country. As recent events have shown, the South Sudan economy is especially vulnerable to weather, oil price, and conflict related shocks. The economy had showed signs of recovery in FY 2018/19 with an estimated growth rate of 3.2% - the first positive GDP growth in five years. While the economy was expected to build on this positive turn and continue on a gradual growth trajectory, FY20 economic growth is estimated at -4.3%, once again highlighting the unique vulnerabilities of South Sudan. Inflation averaged 87% during the first nine months of FY2019/20 higher than during FY2018/19. The gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel market rate remains high and was estimated at 103% in June 2020.South Sudan continues to under-invest in sectors that would have the largest knock-on effect on poverty reduction and building resilience, with expenditures skewed toward defense and security at the expense of service delivery. Consequently, poverty levels are expected to remain extremely high on the back of severe food insecurity and limited access to basic services across the country. About 82% of the population in South Sudan is poor according to the most recent estimates, based on the $1.90 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) poverty line.The main priority for the government is to address the underlying causes of the conflict and restore peace and stability across the country in line with the provisions in the R-ARCSS. To ensure economic recovery, the government will need to implement comprehensive macroeconomic reforms, including measures to reduce inflation, address foreign exchange distortions, as well as longer term action to diversify the economy. Strengthening Public Financial Management systems and pursuing a people centered public investment program will support resilience, reduce poverty, build a stock of human capital, and secure the future.

        The World Bank has been engaged since the conclusion of the North-South Agreement in 2005 and the creation of the autonomous Government of Southern Sudan. After independence, in April 2012, South Sudan became a member of the World Bank Group (WBG) and an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was endorsed by the Board to cover the years FY2013-14. The resumption of conflict, however, was a critical setback to the country program and for development in general.Following the signing of a peace agreement and the formation of the Transitional Unity Government in 2015 aiming at ending the 2013 internal conflict, the World Bank started preparing a Country Engagement Note (CEN) to guide its intervention in the country over a period of 24 months (FY2018-19). While, the resumption of conflict in July 2016 delayed its preparation, the CEN was finalized and endorsed by the Board of Executive Directors on January 16, 2018.The CEN was informed by the findings of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (October 2015) which identified the key constraints and opportunities facing the country in achieving adequate progress toward the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable way. Its design involved extensive consultations with key stakeholders and took into consideration the comparative advantage of World Bank engagement in South Sudan. The aims of the CEN are to respond to the current crisis and support stabilization, recovery, and peace where opportunities arise. The World Bank engagement strategy in South Sudan comprises two objectives: (i) Support basic service provision for vulnerable populations and (ii) Support to livelihoods, food security, and basic economic recovery.The FY18–19 World Bank Group Country Engagement Note (CEN) for South Sudan will effectively be replaced by a new Country Engagement Note FY21-22, that is currently under preparation and that will guide WBG engagement in South Sudan for a 24-month period.

        Development partners have played a major role in South Sudan for the past several years. Their commitments have totaled about $4.5 billion, excluding $4 billion in contributions to United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMISS) peacekeeping for the same period. Funding modalities have varied, with 19% of donor funding allocated to pooled funds through 2011. The World Bank Group (WBG) has been working closely with development partners through the WBG-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund – South Sudan (MDTF-SS), the largest of five pooled funds.With the closing of the MDTF-SS in 2013 and following two conflict outbreaks in December 2013 and July 2016, the World Bank developed flexible and innovative programs to prevent a complete deterioration of livelihoods and maintain essential services for the people of South Sudan by identifying and targeting those most in need. The bulk of the Bank’s support is currently delivered in partnership with UN agencies with extensive presence across the country.World Bank is also an active member of the Partnership for Recovery and Resilience (PfRR) in South Sudan and intends to contribute towards re-establishing delivery of basic services and restore productive capacities of communities affected by the conflict.

        The Central African Republic, a landlocked country with a population of close to 4.9 million, embarked on a long recovery process, following a major security crisis in 2013 that unraveled its social fabric and displaced over 25% of its population.Political ContextElections in 2016 brought an end to three years of political transition and turmoil.Since 2016, the Central African Republic has been governed by President Faustin-Archange Touadéra and Prime Minister Simplice Sarandji. The next presidential elections are scheduled to be held between December 2020 and March 2021.On February 6, 2019, the Government of the Central African Republic signed an African Union-mediated peace agreement with 14 armed groups. This agreement has been endorsed by the international community. The African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) serve as guarantors of the agreement, while the UN peacekeeping force (MINUSCA) plays a critical support role in the background. Economic OverviewEconomic growth in the Central African Republic slowed to 3.7% in 2018, as renewed insecurity inhibited economic activity by disrupting agricultural, forestry and mining production, and delaying investment projects. However, since 2015, economic growth in the country has outpaced the CEMAC average and is projected to reach 4.8% in 2019.The Central African Republic would benefit from maintaining its fiscal discipline, because it remains at high risk of debt distress. The government’s efforts continue to yield positive outcomes, with a debt-to-GDP ratio that declined to 49%. Debt indicators are expected to steadily improve over the medium term. The overall deficit is estimated to rise to 2.7% of GDP in 2019, up from 1.6% in 2017. At 9% of GDP in 2018, the Central African Republic still has one of the lowest domestic revenue-to-GDP ratios in Sub-Saharan Africa. Public spending increased to 16.3% of GDP in 2018, in tandem with a rise in expenditure on goods and services.  Grants remain high at 7.8% of GDP in 2018 and are projected to reach 11% in 2019, thanks to support from the development partners for the peace agreement.If the security situation does not deteriorate, the medium-term outlook for the country is positive. The expected steady improvement in security, the gradual re-establishment of public services in the provinces, the uptick in public and private investments, and reform implementation are projected to push growth to 4.8% in 2019.Social Context and Development ChallengesPoverty remains high and projections suggest that roughly 71% of the population was living below the international poverty line ($1.90 per day, in terms of PPP) in 2018.Approximately 643,000 people remain internally displaced while 575,000 Central African refugees sought shelter in neighboring countries. It is expected that in 2019, 2.9 million Central Africans—more than half of the country’s population—will need humanitarian assistance, with 1.6 million people in acute need. In order to meet humanitarian needs, on January 7, 2019 the Government of the Central African Republic and the Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA) officially launched the $430.7 million Humanitarian Response Plan for the year.The Central African Republic remains one of the poorest countries in the world and is grappling with numerous human capital challenges. It ranks near the very bottom of the UN Human Development Index (188 out of 189 countries in December 2018), which could present devastating consequences for its future generation. While the most recent estimates show that more than 71% of the population is poor, there have been improvements in the provision of key public services in the country’s southwestern region.Maternal mortality is among the world’s highest (882 per 100,000 live births), while the extremely high under-five child mortality rate (179 per 1,000) highlights the severity of the health situation. The Central African Republic has some of the lowest education and gender equality indicators in the world. The poor quality of primary education, the lack of secondary school education for girls, and violence against women and girls, with 11,000 reported incidents each year (2016), 74% of which involve children, remain pressing challenges for the country.Average life expectancy is 53 years. High levels of malnutrition exist, with 41% of the population suffering from chronic malnutrition (stunting). The fertility rate is high at 6.2 children per woman.Last Updated: Nov 25, 2019","

        During the crisis, the World Bank allocated $100 million to emergency operations through a grant from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Group’s fund for the poorest.The World Bank also co-led a recovery and peacebuilding assessment and played a key role at the international donor conference for the Central African Republic in November 2016, which resulted in $2.2 billion in pledges ($2 billion for reconstruction and $200 million for humanitarian assistance).The activities of the World Bank in Central African Republic over the next five years will be guided by the partnership framework currently being finalized and will focus primarily on human capital development.This new partnership framework is aligned with the government’s three priorities: Support peace, reconciliation, and security in order to create an environment in which development can take place;Re-establish the social link between the State and the people, by addressing all grievances and ensuring the equitable provision of public services;Promote economic growth and job creation.The World Bank is currently financing a $250 million economic recovery program to support short-term stabilization efforts and long-term development activities. This program includes:A financial reform project to strengthen State capacity and improve resource allocation;Support for the reintegration of former combatants and for displaced populations;Financing to improve water and energy service delivery, social services, and ICT. In addition, support for the agricultural, mining, and forestry sectors and for access to the major production basins should create much-needed jobs.Last Updated: Nov 25, 2019"

        A landlocked Sahelian country in central Africa, Chad grapples with security challenges associated with conflicts in bordering countries as well as the impacts of climate change, which is exacerbating desertification and the drying up of Lake Chad.With more than 450,000 refugees from Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Nigeria, Chad continues to deal with the consequences of tension in neighboring countries and hosts a high number of refugees, who represent approximately 4% of the country’s total population. Although Chad had made progress on poverty reduction, with a decline in the national poverty rate from 55% to 47% between 2003 and 2011, the number of poor people is projected to increase from 4.7 million to 6.3 million between 2011 and 2019.  The country is ranked last on the World Bank’s Human Capital Index. This means that a child born in Chad today will be 71% less productive in adulthood than a child who received a quality education and benefited from appropriate health services. Moreover, 20% of Chadian children will not make it to their fifth birthday, and 40% of children suffer from stunting, which can have long-term implications for their cognitive development. Between the ages of 4 and 18, on average, children in Chad spend no more than five years in school. Chad also has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in central Africa, with 856 deaths for every 100,000 live births. This phenomenon is aggravated by the high number of early pregnancies (164.5 births per 1,000 adolescents aged 15 to 19), which often lead to complications for the adolescents. Political ContextPresident Idriss Déby Itno and his party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), have dominated Chadian politics since ascending to power in December 1990. The new constitution, promulgated in 2018, allows the President to run for two additional consecutive terms of six years when his current term comes to an end in 2021.The Independent National Electoral Commission announced that the first round of the presidential elections will be held on April 11, 2021. Legislative and municipal elections, which have been postponed several times because of a lack of funds, are scheduled to be held on October 24, 2021. Economic OutlookChad joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003 and since then its economy has been heavily dependent on oil. The country’s previously agrarian economy saw per capita GDP grow from about $497 in 2001/02 (which was less than half of the average in Sub-Saharan Africa) to around $823 in 2017. After two years of a deep recession caused by the drop in oil prices, the economy showed signs of recovery in 2018. GDP grew by 3.2% in 2019, however, but is expected to decline sharply in 2020 to 0.8%, owing to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The external current account deficit fell from 6.6% to 4.7% between 2018 and 2019 as a result of the hike in oil prices and strong oil export performance. The government is continuing its fiscal accommodation efforts by mobilizing revenue and controlling recurrent costs. In June 2018, Chad finalized the restructuring of its oil-collateralized loan with the Glencore petroleum company. This agreement and the planned clearance of arrears is expected to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 51.9% in 2017 to 41.2% in 2020. The risk of external debt overhang nevertheless remains high.In the medium term, oil exports will remain a key driver of GDP growth. Moreover, the privatization of the public cotton company is expected to considerably improve the contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP growth. Chad’s economy remains fragile and is vulnerable to considerable risk, such as oil price volatility and regional insecurity. Chad would benefit from investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure, education, and health to mitigate these risks. Last Updated: Jul 03, 2020","

        World Bank Group Engagement in ChadWorld Bank Group engagement in Chad is guided by a Country Partnership Framework (CPF) that is reassessed and renewed on average every four years. The current CPF covers the period 2016-2020. The World Bank will soon carry out an assessment of the economic and social situation in Chad to prepare its next development support strategy for Chad. Aligned with the government’s priorities, the current CPF aims to achieve the following:Improve public resources management; Boost agricultural productivity and value chains; andStrengthen human capital (health, nutrition, education) and reduce vulnerability.Through the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Group is currently financing 19 operations: 12 national projects, for a total commitment of $529.4 million, and seven regional projects totaling $336.7 million. The World Bank also disbursed $16.9 million in emergency financing on April 28, 2020 to help the government respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is providing support for food security and livelihoods. These interventions, which are estimated at $21.7 million, are accompanied by emergency budget support for economic stabilization. To help Sahelian countries stabilize the region and expedite their development, the World Bank became a member of the Sahel Alliance, launched in July 2017, with the goal of enhancing coordination among partners to provide aid more rapidly and effectively and better targeted to vulnerable zones. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, has invested in the mobile telecommunications (Milicom) and health (Clinique Providence) sectors as well as in industries and services. In collaboration with the World Bank, IFC is helping the Chadian government with the implementation of reforms needed to improve the business climate. IFC is also exploring the possibility of strengthening agricultural sectors such as cotton, gum Arabic, sesame, and livestock, as well as providing technical advisory services and assistance to improve access to financing in Chad.

        A landlocked Sahelian country in central Africa, Chad grapples with security challenges associated with conflicts in bordering countries as well as the impacts of climate change, which is exacerbating desertification and the drying up of Lake Chad.With more than 450,000 refugees from Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Nigeria, Chad continues to deal with the consequences of tension in neighboring countries and hosts a high number of refugees, who represent approximately 4% of the country’s total population. Although Chad had made progress on poverty reduction, with a decline in the national poverty rate from 55% to 47% between 2003 and 2011, the number of poor people is projected to increase from 4.7 million to 6.3 million between 2011 and 2019.  The country is ranked last on the World Bank’s Human Capital Index. This means that a child born in Chad today will be 71% less productive in adulthood than a child who received a quality education and benefited from appropriate health services. Moreover, 20% of Chadian children will not make it to their fifth birthday, and 40% of children suffer from stunting, which can have long-term implications for their cognitive development. Between the ages of 4 and 18, on average, children in Chad spend no more than five years in school. Chad also has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in central Africa, with 856 deaths for every 100,000 live births. This phenomenon is aggravated by the high number of early pregnancies (164.5 births per 1,000 adolescents aged 15 to 19), which often lead to complications for the adolescents. Political ContextPresident Idriss Déby Itno and his party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), have dominated Chadian politics since ascending to power in December 1990. The new constitution, promulgated in 2018, allows the President to run for two additional consecutive terms of six years when his current term comes to an end in 2021.The Independent National Electoral Commission announced that the first round of the presidential elections will be held on April 11, 2021. Legislative and municipal elections, which have been postponed several times because of a lack of funds, are scheduled to be held on October 24, 2021. Economic OutlookChad joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003 and since then its economy has been heavily dependent on oil. The country’s previously agrarian economy saw per capita GDP grow from about $497 in 2001/02 (which was less than half of the average in Sub-Saharan Africa) to around $823 in 2017. After two years of a deep recession caused by the drop in oil prices, the economy showed signs of recovery in 2018. GDP grew by 3.2% in 2019, however, but is expected to decline sharply in 2020 to 0.8%, owing to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The external current account deficit fell from 6.6% to 4.7% between 2018 and 2019 as a result of the hike in oil prices and strong oil export performance. The government is continuing its fiscal accommodation efforts by mobilizing revenue and controlling recurrent costs. In June 2018, Chad finalized the restructuring of its oil-collateralized loan with the Glencore petroleum company. This agreement and the planned clearance of arrears is expected to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 51.9% in 2017 to 41.2% in 2020. The risk of external debt overhang nevertheless remains high.In the medium term, oil exports will remain a key driver of GDP growth. Moreover, the privatization of the public cotton company is expected to considerably improve the contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP growth. Chad’s economy remains fragile and is vulnerable to considerable risk, such as oil price volatility and regional insecurity. Chad would benefit from investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure, education, and health to mitigate these risks. Last Updated: Jul 03, 2020","

        Number of Active Projects6 projectsIBRD LendingUS$865 million Knowledge20 ongoing knowledge activities, including studies, technical assistance, and Reimbursable Advisory ServicesThe World Bank has been a partner to Croatia for over 26 years. During this period, the Bank has supported more than 50 projects worth roughly US$4 billion, produced numerous studies, and provided technical assistance to help strengthen institutions and support the design of policies and strategies. The current Country Partnership Framework for the period of 2019–24 is aimed at supporting Croatia on its path toward an inclusive society where communities, businesses, and regions can prosper for the benefit of all Croatians; where public institutions provide effective and efficient services; and where Croatia’s rich natural capital is preserved and used in a sustainable manner.The Bank’s current program focuses on the mitigation of the economic and social impact of COVID-19, post-earthquake reconstruction, transport, justice, innovation, the business environment, land administration, agriculture, and the economic development of the Slavonia region. KEY ENGAGEMENTThe World Bank’s recent program includes two projects, totaling US$500 million, that provide emergency support to the Croatian authorities and focus on cushioning the effects of the double shock that hit the country earlier this year. The US$300 million Crisis Response and Recovery Development Policy Operation supports the Government’s swift and targeted economic packages approved in March and April 2020 to mitigate the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis. It also addresses some of Croatia’s long-standing institutional gaps and helps to build the foundations of an inclusive and sustainable recovery. The US$200 million Earthquake Recovery and Public Health Preparedness Emergency Recovery Project is the first substantial reconstruction loan for Zagreb following the devastating March earthquake. The project will help with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of critical public services in health and education facilities. It will help with the design of a financial support program for private housing reconstruction, to be financed through public, private, and other financiers, and strengthen the institutional capacity of the national authorities to respond to future disasters and manage future risks. The project will also help the country to deal with future public health outbreaks, strengthen disease surveillance systems, and develop epidemiological capacity for the early detection and confirmation of diseases. It will support the repair, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of public health laboratories and finance the necessary equipment, including for active contact tracing and the reporting of new cases. Additional World Bank activities include the Justice for Business Project, which is aimed at improving business regulatory procedures and judicial service standards for businesses and citizens. Reforms are focusing on reducing the administrative burden for companies to interact with government, removing regulatory barriers for firms to enter the market and operate, simplifying the process of obtaining construction permits, and improving market functioning in the construction sector.The Bank is also supporting the restructuring of public roads and railway companies to make them more competitive and financially less reliant on state subsidies and helping to modernize land registration. 8 loans (€ 605.7)8 loans (€ 605.7)

        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSIn the first half of 2020, Croatia’s real GDP decreased by 7.8 percent, primarily reflecting a record decline in the second quarter of -15.1 percent. The largest negative contribution to growth came from external demand, amid widespread travel bans that affected Croatia’s large tourism sector and related activities. Domestic demand also contracted significantly, with government consumption the only demand side component to grow. On the supply side, activities linked to tourism and transport were hit the most. The Government introduced significant support measures to help mitigate the economic and social impacts of the crisis.  The Central Bank managed to keep the exchange rate stable despite strong depreciation pressures and provided the necessary liquidity to financial markets. In July 2020, Croatia joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), one of the key steps in the process of adopting the euro. Fiscal stimulus measures, together with falling economic activity, have taken a heavy toll on government finances. The central government deficit in the first six months of 2020 reached the highest level on record. A Rapid Household Assessment of COVID-19 impacts indicated that low-wage earners are more likely to be affected by the crisis than those in the top income brackets. In addition, 26 percent of households experienced more difficulties in earning enough income to meet basic needs in June than in the pre-COVID-19 period. The same proportion of households reported a decline in income. Thus, poverty is predicted to rise from 3.0 percent in 2019 to 3.6 percent in 2020, amounting to approximately 20,000 additional Croatians living on less than US$5.5 a day at 2011 purchasing power parity prices.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKReal GDP in Croatia is expected to decline by 8.1 percent this year, largely due to the country’s strong reliance on tourism, the sector most affected by the crisis. Although the easing of border restrictions since June has significantly helped the tourism sector, it is still going to bear the brunt of the impact, with a more than 40 percent decline in export revenues compared to 2019. Given the fiscal expansion and falling economic activity, Croatia is expected to register a fiscal deficit of close to 7 percent of GDP. This will temporarily reverse the downward trajectory of government debt that could, by the end of the year, reach almost 87 percent of GDP. Under the assumption that the pandemic will be gradually brought under control, real GDP’s upward trend could resume in 2021 with a strong rebound in tourism revenues. A recovery of investments will be supported by an inflow of EU funds and by an acceleration of reconstruction after the earthquake.  The crisis will have an impact on poor working households that have been disproportionately affected by unemployment. Low savings rates among these households limit their ability to mitigate the impact of income loss on consumption. Even among those with savings, more than two-thirds will likely run out of funds within the next six months. In addition, a decline in international remittances is expected to negatively affect the income of recipients at home. Current safety net programs may not be sufficient to offset households’ total welfare losses given their limited financial space.

        For almost a year, Lebanon has been assailed by compounded crises—specifically, an economic and financial crisis, followed by COVID-19, and lastly the explosion at the Port of Beirut (PoB). In October 2019, the economy plunged into a financial crisis brought about by a sudden stop in capital inflows, which precipitated systemic failures across the banking sector and debt sector, as well as effecting the exchange rate. Subsequently, on March 7, 2020, the Government defaulted on the redemption of a US$1.2 billion Eurobond, marking Lebanon’s first-ever sovereign default. Then, on March 18, the Government declared a State of General Mobilization, imposing a lockdown to counter COVID-19 that included the closure of the borders (air, sea, and land) and of public and private institutions. Lastly, on August 4, 2020, a massive explosion rocked the Port of Beirut, destroying much of the port and severely damaging dense residential and commercial areas within a 1- to 2-mile radius of it. Beyond the human tragedy, the economic impact of the explosion has implications at the national level, despite the explosion’s geographical concentration. This adds to long-term structural vulnerabilities that include low-grade infrastructure—a dysfunctional electricity sector, water supply shortages, inadequate solid waste and wastewater management—public financial mismanagement, large macroeconomic imbalances, and deteriorating social indicators. Immediately after the Port of Beirut explosion, the World Bank Group (WBG), in cooperation with the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU), launched a Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA) to estimate the impact on the population, physical assets, infrastructure, and service delivery. The RDNA followed a “whole of Lebanon approach” by engaging the public authorities, institutions, and civil society organizations concerned. The assessment found that the value of damage from the explosion was in the range of US$3.8 to 4.6 billion, with losses to financial flows of US$2.9 to US$3.5 billion. The impact is particularly severe in key sectors vital for growth, including finance, housing, tourism, and commerce. Through to the end of 2021, the costs of recovery and reconstruction are expected to total US$1.8 to $2.2 billion. Apart from losses in economic activity, Lebanon can expect lower fiscal revenues, higher inflation, and a further rise in poverty. Trade disruptions are also possible, which would raise transaction costs and further impede growth. The RDNA recommends a framework for Reform, Recovery, and Reconstruction (the '3Rs') to build back a better Lebanon, one based on principles of transparency, inclusion, and accountability. The 3Rs’ framework combines people-centered interventions with structural reforms that include macroeconomic stabilization and ensuring human security, and reforms to governance mechanisms and the private-sector’s operating environment.Building a better Lebanon will require swift and decisive action, particularly on reform. In the immediate term, Lebanon needs to adopt and implement a credible, comprehensive, and coordinated macro-financial stability strategy, within a medium-term macro-fiscal framework. This strategy would be based on: (i) a debt restructuring program aimed at achieving debt sustainability over the medium-term; (ii) a comprehensive restructuring of the financial sector toward regaining the solvency of the banking sector; (iii) a new monetary policy framework aimed at regaining confidence in the exchange rate and its stability; (iv) a phased fiscal adjustment aimed at regaining confidence in fiscal policy; (v) growth enhancing reforms; and (vi) enhanced social protection. Over the medium-term, Lebanon will have to prioritize building better institutions, good governance, and a better business environment, alongside physical reconstruction. However, given Lebanon’s state of insolvency (sovereign, banking system) and its lack of sufficient foreign exchange reserves, international aid and private investment will be essential for a comprehensive recovery and reconstruction. The extent and speed to which aid and investments are mobilized will depend on whether the authorities and the Lebanese Parliament can act swiftly on enacting much needed fiscal, financial, social, and governance reforms. Without reforms, there can be no sustainable recovery and reconstruction, and the social and economic situation will continue to worsen.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Framework (CPF) (FY17–FY22) for the Lebanese Republic was launched on July 14, 2016. Informed by a broad range of consultations with the Government, Parliament, private sector and civil society, the CPF is focused on: (i) scaling up access to and the quality of service delivery; and (ii) expanding economic opportunities and increasing human capital. Within these areas, the WBG is helping Lebanon mitigate the economic and social impact of the Syria crisis, safeguard development gains, and improve its chances of stability and its development prospects in coming years. Cross-cutting themes of governance and renewing the social contract aim to help regain the trust of citizens through social and economic inclusion and enhancing the quality of public services. The CPF also mainstreams gender, in particular for expanding economic opportunities and increasing human capital.  In parallel, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will continue to pursue viable opportunities to support private sector development through investments and advisory work in key sectors, with the aim of increasing employment opportunities. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will continue working with IFC to identify and support eligible cross-border investments in Lebanon. The World Bank Group is currently preparing a Progress and Learning Review (PLR) to assess the progress achieved to date by the Lebanon program, identify the lessons learned, formulate a forward-looking plan to tackle the country’s most pressing challenges, and move forward with a comprehensive social agenda to protect Lebanon’s poor households and create a growth dynamic to direct the country towards economic recovery. The PLR will adopt flexible tools to factor in the current crises, provide practical advisory support, and devise a plan that contributes to strengthening Lebanon’s economic and social immunity.As of September 2020, the World Bank’s total commitment in Lebanon amounts to US$1.4 billion, consisting of 10 active projects (loans and grants) and covering a range of sectors, including water, transport, education, health, poverty targeting, the environment, and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). These projects are financed from a variety of sources, including special mechanisms such as the Global Concessional Financing Facility, which is providing financing to help Lebanon mitigate the fallout of the Syrian conflict and the impact of the influx of Syrian refugees.Lebanon has also obtained US$100 million in financing from the International Development Association, whose funding is normally reserved for Low-Income Countries, not those classified as Middle-Income Countries, such as Lebanon. The program is complemented by a number of Advisory Services and Analytics that aim to provide important economic and social, evidence-based diagnostics, which serve as data platforms to inform project design and stakeholders. Full list of World Bank-funded Operations in Lebanon.WBG Support for Responding to the COVID-19 PandemicLebanon continues to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic through intermittent lockdowns and measures that mitigate the impact of the virus on the population and on the already weak health system in the country.A number of ongoing projects in Lebanon have been restructured to help fund the country’s immediate needs due to coronavirus crisis, as efforts are mobilized toward “saving lives”: (i) the Health Resilience Project (US$120 million) was restructured to add a component on COVID-19 response activities (US$40 million) to assist in country preparedness and response capabilities, the training of health workers and frontline responders, covering the cost of hospital care for COVID-19 patients, and strengthening the capacity of public hospitals through the urgent procurement of goods; (ii) the ISME Project (US$30 million) was restructured to reallocate US$5.5 million from existing components to a new component entitled “Emergency Financing Facility ISME COVID-19 Funding Program” to provide financial support to Lebanese firms or research centers that have or could develop the capability to produce the medical supplies, equipment, and services needed to fight COVID-19. The program is not yet launched but awaiting approval by Parliament; and (iii) the Roads and Employment Project is being considered for restructuring in order to allocate US$10 million to support Lebanese farmers with inputs and materials to ensure their continued planting and animal production, and thus their ability to contribute to the country’s food security. Efforts have been redoubled for “Protecting poor and vulnerable people” severely affected by the protracted economic crisis and COVID19 crisis and supporting the establishment of a robust social safety net system in Lebanon. International Finance Corporation (IFC) IFC’s strategy in Lebanon has been focused on financial markets (including microfinance) to increase access to finance for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Prior to the current crisis, selective investments in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors were underway to help create jobs, in addition to intra- and inter-regional investments with Lebanese investors. In addition to the IFC’s PPP transaction advisory interventions in the transport and energy sectors, which were underway prior to the current crisis, other IFC advisory activities in Lebanon are aimed at improving the investment climate and introducing innovative approaches that leverage the dynamism of Lebanon’s private sector—in areas such as climate change—through sustainable energy finance, women in banking, corporate governance, and MSME development.  IFC’s net, committed exposure in Lebanon as of July 31, 2020 totaled US$208 million. Current macroeconomic challenges and significant risk premiums in the country have resulted in a significant drop in IFC’s exposure, particularly under IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program. The largest part of IFC’s exposure today remains in the financial sector, followed by the construction and retail sectors. Given the intensifying financial crisis in Lebanon, coupled by COVID-19 pandemic and the tragic events at the port of Beirut, IFC is currently closely engaged with IBRD and other IFIs in addressing the crisis-related challenges the Lebanese private sector is facing, in part through the Port of Beirut RDNA and the operational progress envisaged for the Reform, Recovery, and Reconstruction Framework (3RF). IFC’s primary focus is to support trade finance for essential goods, access to short-term capital for productive MSMEs, and refinancing support for microfinance institutions. IFC anticipates fostering upstream and mainstream interventions through the IFC 3.0 strategy, with a focus on creating markets and opportunities in close collaboration with IBRD. In the medium- to long-term, by embarking on the 3RF and the World Bank Group’s Maximizing Finance for Development agenda, IFC acknowledges the importance of the implementation of structural reforms in Lebanon to sustainable development in priority sectors, with the aim of unlocking potential long-term leads in energy, transportation, and waste management. IFC will continue to pursue credible interventions in relevantly competitive productive sectors of the Lebanese economy, such as agribusiness, manufacturing, and services. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) MIGA’s outstanding exposure in Lebanon stands at US$35 million and is related to guarantees on an electricity distribution services provider under a PPP contract with the national utility Electricité du Liban. The project was signed for in FY14 and extended for an additional four years in FY18. Prior to the tragedy of August 4, 2020 and change in government, MIGA was working closely with the World Bank, IFC, and multilateral partners to identify projects financed by foreign private investors which would support the recovery of Lebanon’s economy and benefit from MIGA’s risk mitigation instruments. Its sectors of focus included transport, ICT, and renewable energy.In the wake of the Port of Beirut tragedy, private capital mobilization will be critical to the recovery of Lebanon’s infrastructure, with support for such investments aligned with MIGA’s strategic focus on FCV countries, where MIGA may deploy its Conflict and Fragility Affected Economies Facility. In recent months, many of the political risks that MIGA covers—including sovereign default, currency restrictions, and civil disturbances—have come to manifest themselves in Lebanon; therefore, reforms that address these challenges will be important to attract investment from the private sector and enable MIGA to play a greater role in Lebanon’s recovery.

        Maldives has a population of around 515,696 people dispersed across 185 islands. The country has been a development success; enjoying robust growth coupled with considerable development of the country’s infrastructure and connectivity. It has also provided high quality and affordable public services for its people, resulting in impressive health and education indicators with a literacy rate approaching 100%, and life expectancy of over 78 years. More than 30 percent of the population live in the capital city Male’. Maldives ranks 101 out of 189 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) for 2017, the second highest HDI rank in South Asia. The country’s GDP per capita reached $11,890 in 2018, compared to $200 in 1978.The country is physically vulnerable to rising sea levels. Eighty percent of the total land area of the country, which is less than 300 square kilometers, is lower than 1 meter above the mean sea level. The country’s exposure to natural hazards and climate variability poses a threat to lives and the economy. The additional challenge of the country’s geography leads to a dispersed population across many small islands, which makes service delivery difficult and can limit opportunities for job creation and economic diversification. Compounded with inclusion issues, this has caused relatively elevated levels of youth unemployment at 15.3 percent and low rates of women participating in the workforce.To respond to these challenges, the government has reversed centralization policies of the previous government, promising to empower local councils by allocating a portion of the annual state budget and to develop at least 5 regional economic hubs across the archipelago. The government has also embarked on a series of reforms to restore democratic institutions and the freedom of the press, re-establish the justice system, and protect fundamental human rights. Also high on the current government’s agenda is climate change.Recent DevelopmentsThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a debilitated effect on tourism, which directly and indirectly accounts for two-thirds of GDP. Revenues fell by an estimated 23.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 (year-on-year) as tourist-related revenues shrank, whereas spending grew by 10.2 percent. Real GDP contracted by 5.9 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q1 2020. The shock is expected to be larger in Q2 due to border closure and stringent mobility restrictions. Tourism inflows remained anemic even after borders reopened in mid-July. Construction, the other main driver of growth, also slumped due to logistical difficulties and repatriations of foreign workers following COVID-19 outbreaks.Fiscal imbalances have widened significantly. Although the state collected only USD 471 million in revenues and grants from January to July (half the amount in the corresponding period of 2019), there was no commensurate adjustment in spending. While there was some degree of fiscal consolidation on the recurrent side, capital spending grew by 16.7 percent y-o-y in the first half of the year, mainly due to land reclamation and harbor reconstruction projects. Total spending amounted to USD 948 million over January to July, only 1.2 percent less than over the same period in 2019. Total public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt rose to USD 4.8 billion as of end-June 2020, a significant increase from USD 4.4 billion as of end-2019. OutlookIn a baseline scenario that assumes borders remain open and tourists gradually return, GDP is projected to shrink by 19.5 percent in 2020. Thereafter, it is expected to rebound to 9.5 percent growth in 2021, largely on account of base effects and the expected resumption of tourism once a COVID-19 vaccine is commercially available, tentatively by mid-year. However, real GDP is forecast to remain below 2019 levels until 2023.Lower remittance outflows and some import compression should help to narrow the current account deficit to 19.5 percent of GDP in 2020. However, the fiscal deficit is projected to more than triple to 22.5 percent of GDP as expenditures have not sufficiently adjusted to lower revenue levels, which are projected to halve. As a result, PPG debt is expected to reach 120 percent of GDP in 2020.COVID-19 will likely cancel the gains in poverty reduction from the last five years. The poverty rate is projected to increase to 5.6 percent in 2020 (measured at USD 5.50 a day in PPP terms) and to decline very slowly thereafter. Even in the baseline scenario, the poverty rate would still be higher in 2021 than in 2016.ChallengesShould a ‘second wave’ materialize and prevent tourists from visiting in Q4 2020, the recession would be even more severe. While the unique “one island, one resort” concept facilitates socially-distanced vacations, difficulties in resuming commercial flights and recent increases in domestic transmission pose challenges to attracting more visitors. Although medium- and long-term tourism prospects remain strong, visitor arrivals are not projected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.  Meanwhile, the potential closure of tourist establishments and other small businesses could result in permanent supply-side losses, hurting long-term growth.Against this backdrop of slower growth and lower revenues, addressing core spending needs will be a challenge. Additional financing may be difficult to raise in the near-term given rising debt levels and the global nature of the shock. Greater fiscal prudence would help address fiscal and debt sustainability risks. In particular, large public infrastructure investments that are not urgently needed in a context of weak aggregate demand could be postponed.The COVID-19 shock has shed renewed light on the importance of strengthening the Maldives’ resilience to external shocks. Although there are plans to develop agriculture and fishing to diversify the economy, the scarcity of arable land is a binding constraint. Focusing on higher value-added financial and business services could create good jobs, but the growth of these sectors is currently constrained by a shortage of local skills. Investing in human capital, including by retraining and upskilling workers, can help Maldives build back better.

While there was some degree of fiscal consolidation on the recurrent side, capital spending grew by 16.7 percent y-o-y in the first half of the year, mainly due to land reclamation and harbor reconstruction projects. Total spending amounted to USD 948 million over January to July, only 1.2 percent less than over the same period in 2019. Total public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt rose to USD 4.8 billion as of end-June 2020, a significant increase from USD 4.4 billion as of end-2019. OutlookIn a baseline scenario that assumes borders remain open and tourists gradually return, GDP is projected to shrink by 19.5 percent in 2020. Thereafter, it is expected to rebound to 9.5 percent growth in 2021, largely on account of base effects and the expected resumption of tourism once a COVID-19 vaccine is commercially available, tentatively by mid-year. However, real GDP is forecast to remain below 2019 levels until 2023.Lower remittance outflows and some import compression should help to narrow the current account deficit to 19.5 percent of GDP in 2020. However, the fiscal deficit is projected to more than triple to 22.5 percent of GDP as expenditures have not sufficiently adjusted to lower revenue levels, which are projected to halve. As a result, PPG debt is expected to reach 120 percent of GDP in 2020.COVID-19 will likely cancel the gains in poverty reduction from the last five years. The poverty rate is projected to increase to 5.6 percent in 2020 (measured at USD 5.50 a day in PPP terms) and to decline very slowly thereafter. Even in the baseline scenario, the poverty rate would still be higher in 2021 than in 2016.ChallengesShould a ‘second wave’ materialize and prevent tourists from visiting in Q4 2020, the recession would be even more severe. While the unique “one island, one resort” concept facilitates socially-distanced vacations, difficulties in resuming commercial flights and recent increases in domestic transmission pose challenges to attracting more visitors. Although medium- and long-term tourism prospects remain strong, visitor arrivals are not projected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.  Meanwhile, the potential closure of tourist establishments and other small businesses could result in permanent supply-side losses, hurting long-term growth.Against this backdrop of slower growth and lower revenues, addressing core spending needs will be a challenge. Additional financing may be difficult to raise in the near-term given rising debt levels and the global nature of the shock. Greater fiscal prudence would help address fiscal and debt sustainability risks. In particular, large public infrastructure investments that are not urgently needed in a context of weak aggregate demand could be postponed.The COVID-19 shock has shed renewed light on the importance of strengthening the Maldives’ resilience to external shocks. Although there are plans to develop agriculture and fishing to diversify the economy, the scarcity of arable land is a binding constraint. Focusing on higher value-added financial and business services could create good jobs, but the growth of these sectors is currently constrained by a shortage of local skills. Investing in human capital, including by retraining and upskilling workers, can help Maldives build back better.

        World Bank Program and MaldivesMaldives became a member of the World Bank in 1978 and has enjoyed a trusted partnership with the institution over the past 41 years. Working together, the country has implemented 32 projects with over $295 million in support across many development areas.The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (FY2016-2019), endorsed by the Maldives and the World Bank board in May 2016, aims to support Maldives to achieve more inclusive and sustainable growth, making better use of the country’s assets – human capital, natural assets, and financial resources. Updated in 2018 based on an evolving country context and lessons from project implementation, the strategy was extended until 2020 and has three major focus areas:1.  Promoting economic opportunities for Maldivians through improving access and quality of primary and secondary education, expanding the economic benefits from the fishing industry, and increasing access to financial services.2.  Building resilience to climate change, natural hazards, and other exogenous shocks through improving environmental management, and enhancing preparedness for disaster risk management and climate change.3.  Strengthening fiscal sustainability through improving efficiency in public financial management.Maldives has a portfolio of eight International Development Agency (IDA) supported projects with a total net commitment of $120.6 million. The projects are focused on fisheries, solid waste management, public financial management, improving employment with a special focus on tourism and IT sectors, renewable energy and urban development. In addition, the Bank is supporting a Disaster Risk Management development policy financing with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO) instrument to provide immediate liquidity in the aftermath of a disaster due to an adverse natural event including public health emergencies.  The Government has also benefited from a fiscal sustainability and budget credibility development policy financing operation, that supports to improve the policy framework to enhance sustainability of public finances and strengthen the policy framework to increase credibility of budget.To enable the Maldivian Government, combat the current COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank has initiated a $7.3 million (with an additional $7.3m co-financing from AIIB) emergency health operation to help the Maldives prevent, detect and diagnose the novel coronavirus. The project is aligned with the country’s 10 National Health Policy Goals, specifically the goal to “enhance the response of the health system in emergencies” including those related to natural disasters and severe disease outbreaks. The support is critical for the Government to continue its investment in improved emergency preparedness, including resources to rapidly respond to public health emergencies before they escalate beyond control. With a fragile ecological profile, high population density in Male, and tourists from all over the world, it is crucial to effectively prevent, control and respond to public health emergencies in a timely manner. Additionally the Bank has also financed a $ 12.8 million COVID-19 Emergency Income Support Project to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis on workers and their families, and to increase the capacity of social protection programs to respond to future emergencies.The World Bank also provides analytical support in macro monitoring and analysis, financial sector, youth and gender, health financing, social protection and poverty. The World Bank Group conducted the second Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) in the Maldives at the end of 2019. The SCD will inform the World Bank Group in formulating its next Country Partnership Framework for the country. The World Bank Group plans to continue providing greater integrated support to strengthen Maldives’ fiscal sustainability, preparedness and resilience to natural disasters, and human capital development as the country continues to reduce poverty and increase prosperity for its people.IFC COLLABORATIONMaldives became a member of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group, in 1983. Since then, IFC has invested over $157 million, including over $8.5 million mobilized from other institutions.   IFC has one active project in its current Maldives portfolio; a 2008 equity investment in the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), which stands at US$ 2.25 million (Equity - 18% stake). IFC partnered with ADB and HDFC Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited, India, to provide an equity and loan investment package, which enabled privatization of HDFC, a government-owned housing finance institution. IFC and ADB invested $4.5 million, while HDFC Investments Limited provided $3.75 million. IFC and ADB also provided a $7.5 million loan each to support the project.In addition to housing finance, IFC has invested in several businesses, including a telecom operator, a leading hotel operator in Maldives, a finance leasing company and a Maldivian sponsor’s South-South investment in Seychelles. IFC’s advisory projects have included support for the Maldives Monetary Authority on establishing a credit bureau and drafting the Non-Banking Financial Institutions Act. IFC has also completed projects promoting green growth, such as advising on resort island energy efficiency and on solid waste management for Male’.

        Maldives has a population of around 515,696 people dispersed across 185 islands. The country has been a development success; enjoying robust growth coupled with considerable development of the country’s infrastructure and connectivity. It has also provided high quality and affordable public services for its people, resulting in impressive health and education indicators with a literacy rate approaching 100%, and life expectancy of over 78 years. More than 30 percent of the population live in the capital city Male’. Maldives ranks 101 out of 189 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) for 2017, the second highest HDI rank in South Asia. The country’s GDP per capita reached $11,890 in 2018, compared to $200 in 1978.The country is physically vulnerable to rising sea levels. Eighty percent of the total land area of the country, which is less than 300 square kilometers, is lower than 1 meter above the mean sea level. The country’s exposure to natural hazards and climate variability poses a threat to lives and the economy. The additional challenge of the country’s geography leads to a dispersed population across many small islands, which makes service delivery difficult and can limit opportunities for job creation and economic diversification. Compounded with inclusion issues, this has caused relatively elevated levels of youth unemployment at 15.3 percent and low rates of women participating in the workforce.To respond to these challenges, the government has reversed centralization policies of the previous government, promising to empower local councils by allocating a portion of the annual state budget and to develop at least 5 regional economic hubs across the archipelago. The government has also embarked on a series of reforms to restore democratic institutions and the freedom of the press, re-establish the justice system, and protect fundamental human rights. Also high on the current government’s agenda is climate change.Recent DevelopmentsThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a debilitated effect on tourism, which directly and indirectly accounts for two-thirds of GDP. Revenues fell by an estimated 23.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 (year-on-year) as tourist-related revenues shrank, whereas spending grew by 10.2 percent. Real GDP contracted by 5.9 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q1 2020. The shock is expected to be larger in Q2 due to border closure and stringent mobility restrictions. Tourism inflows remained anemic even after borders reopened in mid-July. Construction, the other main driver of growth, also slumped due to logistical difficulties and repatriations of foreign workers following COVID-19 outbreaks.Fiscal imbalances have widened significantly. Although the state collected only USD 471 million in revenues and grants from January to July (half the amount in the corresponding period of 2019), there was no commensurate adjustment in spending.

        Improving social safety nets: The COVID-19 Emergency Income Support Project supports to enhance social safety nets so they can better protect Maldivians against future shocks; while financing the development of a new National Social Protection Framework to better coordinate social protection policy.Strengthening Public Financial Management: With the Bank’s support, the Ministry of Finance has made considerable progress on improving transparency through making the budget and financial information available through an integrated financial management system. In addition, the Ministry has reduced the fiscal deficit – slashing it from 10.6% of GDP in 2016 to 2.5% in 2017 – and strengthened revenue collection.Climate change adaptation and mitigation: Bank interventions in wetland management have successfully established two protected areas, with management units and facilities for visitors to support the conservation of fresh/brackish water wetlands with systematic planning and wide stakeholder engagement in the Southern Atolls of Addu and Fuvahmulah. Subsequently, as a result of this success, the Government has recently declared 2 more Protected Areas through Gazette notifications – one each in the Shaviyani and Huvadhoo atolls. In addition, in September 2020 four eco-rich sites in Addu City has also been designated as protected areas, which has been already submitted to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2019, for consideration to list as Biosphere Reserves of Addu.Additionally, the current portfolio is seeking to: enhance the conservation of fisheries and incomes of fishermen through the Sustainable Fisheries Resources Development (SFRD) Project; increase renewable energy generation, mobilizing private investments,  through the ASPIRE Project; create a circular economy for waste reduction, reuse, and recycling by means of integrated waste management systems through the Maldives Clean Environment Project; accelerate human capital accumulation, increase employment opportunities for young people, and promote equitable economic and social progress in the country through the Enhancing Employability and Resilience of Youth Project; and enhance resilient infrastructure and urban planning in selected urban centers and strengthen the government’s capacity to provide effective response to disasters through the Maldives Urban Development and Resilience Project (MUDRP).

        Mauritania is essentially a desert country, with vast expanses of pastoral land and only 0.5% of arable land. According to the National Statistics Office, Mauritania has a population of about 4 million (2018), and a population density of 3.9 inhabitants per square kilometer, making it the fourth least densely populated country in Africa. By 2020, the country will have more urban than rural inhabitants, with 52.8% of the population living in urban areas, against 48.3% in 2013.Political ContextFollowing the decision by President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz to abide by the Constitution and not seek a third term, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani won the first round of the presidential elections held on June 22, 2019 with 52% of the vote, marking the first democratic transition of power in Mauritania. President Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani assumed office in August 2019 and formed his government.Economic OverviewThe economy continued its gradual recovery in 2018. GDP growth has been on an upward trajectory since 2015, rising from 3.1% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2018. This increase was driven by robust activity in the telecommunications, transport, electricity, and primary sectors.By contrast, the extractive sector continues to curb growth. In addition, strong population growth (roughly 2.8%) is outstripping the pace of economic recovery, which remains slow, with real GDP per capita income having risen a mere 0.6%. This situation jeopardizes the gains made in poverty reduction between 2008 and 2014.The fiscal position continued to improve in 2018. Efforts to achieve fiscal rebalancing helped transform the deficit of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 into a surplus of 1.5% in 2018, the first surplus since 2013. However, unfavorable terms of trade, combined with persistent production challenges in the extractive industries, exacerbated the current account deficit, which rose from 13.9% of GDP in 2018 to 18.7% of GDP in 2019. Despite the deepening deficit, financing was ensured by an increase of foreign direct investment linked to offshore gas exploration and financial flows from the extractive sectors.Medium-Term OutlookThe medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to increase to an average of 6.2% for the 2019-2021 period. Continued expansion of the primary sector, strengthening of the services sector through the implementation of structural reforms, and an increase in mining production are expected to keep the country on this sound path. This robust macroeconomic framework is expected to strengthen, provided the government maintains fiscal prudence, by ensuring that public debt remains viable. An improvement in the terms of trade owing to an increase in international iron prices is expected to mitigate external pressures and allow the central bank to respond to financing needs.Social ContextMauritania experienced sustained GDP growth from 2008 to 2014, accompanied by significant improvements in household welfare. The annual real growth in mean household expenditure per capita was 1.52%. All quantiles did well and there was a sharp decline in the proportion of poor, which fell from 44.5% of the country’s population in 2008 to 33% in 2014. The improvement in living standards has been more marked among the poor and extremely poor than among the non-poor. Inequality has narrowed, as  the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, decreased from 35.3 in 2008 to 31.9 in 2014. These developments are explained by improvements in production, productivity, and income in rural areas following the restructuring of the agriculture and livestock sector and by other factors such as internal migration and changes in relative prices.However, some population groups in Mauritania have not benefited from this phenomenon, and the country is still lagging on many social indicators. Poverty has not fallen in the capital, Nouakchott, probably because of migration to urban areas and because the capital tends to attract the poorest of the poor.

        Mauritania is essentially a desert country, with vast expanses of pastoral land and only 0.5% of arable land. According to the National Statistics Office, Mauritania has a population of about 4 million (2018), and a population density of 3.9 inhabitants per square kilometer, making it the fourth least densely populated country in Africa. By 2020, the country will have more urban than rural inhabitants, with 52.8% of the population living in urban areas, against 48.3% in 2013.Political ContextFollowing the decision by President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz to abide by the Constitution and not seek a third term, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani won the first round of the presidential elections held on June 22, 2019 with 52% of the vote, marking the first democratic transition of power in Mauritania. President Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani assumed office in August 2019 and formed his government.Economic OverviewThe economy continued its gradual recovery in 2018. GDP growth has been on an upward trajectory since 2015, rising from 3.1% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2018. This increase was driven by robust activity in the telecommunications, transport, electricity, and primary sectors.By contrast, the extractive sector continues to curb growth. In addition, strong population growth (roughly 2.8%) is outstripping the pace of economic recovery, which remains slow, with real GDP per capita income having risen a mere 0.6%. This situation jeopardizes the gains made in poverty reduction between 2008 and 2014.The fiscal position continued to improve in 2018. Efforts to achieve fiscal rebalancing helped transform the deficit of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 into a surplus of 1.5% in 2018, the first surplus since 2013. However, unfavorable terms of trade, combined with persistent production challenges in the extractive industries, exacerbated the current account deficit, which rose from 13.9% of GDP in 2018 to 18.7% of GDP in 2019. Despite the deepening deficit, financing was ensured by an increase of foreign direct investment linked to offshore gas exploration and financial flows from the extractive sectors.Medium-Term OutlookThe medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to increase to an average of 6.2% for the 2019-2021 period. Continued expansion of the primary sector, strengthening of the services sector through the implementation of structural reforms, and an increase in mining production are expected to keep the country on this sound path. This robust macroeconomic framework is expected to strengthen, provided the government maintains fiscal prudence, by ensuring that public debt remains viable. An improvement in the terms of trade owing to an increase in international iron prices is expected to mitigate external pressures and allow the central bank to respond to financing needs.Social ContextMauritania experienced sustained GDP growth from 2008 to 2014, accompanied by significant improvements in household welfare. The annual real growth in mean household expenditure per capita was 1.52%. All quantiles did well and there was a sharp decline in the proportion of poor, which fell from 44.5% of the country’s population in 2008 to 33% in 2014. The improvement in living standards has been more marked among the poor and extremely poor than among the non-poor. Inequality has narrowed, as  the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, decreased from 35.3 in 2008 to 31.9 in 2014. These developments are explained by improvements in production, productivity, and income in rural areas following the restructuring of the agriculture and livestock sector and by other factors such as internal migration and changes in relative prices.However, some population groups in Mauritania have not benefited from this phenomenon, and the country is still lagging on many social indicators. Poverty has not fallen in the capital, Nouakchott, probably because of migration to urban areas and because the capital tends to attract the poorest of the poor. Labor force participation and the employment rate have not improved, and groups that have not benefited from social progress, such as youth, women, and low-income workers, are increasingly marginalized. Only 55% of children aged 6 to 11 are enrolled in primary school, one third of households live in precarious housing, and 38% of the population has access to electric lighting.

        Local Government Development ProgramThe National Integrated Support Program for Decentralization, Local Development, and Youth Employment (PNIDDLE) is a flagship program of the Mauritanian government that targets the country’s poorest municipalities. Financed with $52 million from the State budget and with support totaling $25 million from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries, this program, launched in 2014, aims to promote local governance by focusing on a participatory approach by the municipalities. The program, which supports 100 municipalities distributed over 10 wilayas in the country, financed the construction and equipping of close to 563 municipal infrastructure projects (schools, health centers, city halls, youth centers, and stadiums) and a significant number of commercial services (municipal markets, slaughterhouses, bus stations). It has facilitated the creation of the equivalent of 1,232 annual full-time jobs and training of 2,000 people (elected officials and municipal and technical staff). The PNIDDLE has also helped with capacity development in the central administrations most involved in its implementation. Lastly, the PNIDDLE financed the completion of numerous studies and reforms relating to decentralization, such as studies on local finances and taxation, the Rural Development Fund (FRD), decentralization of the municipal procurement system, and the national decentralization and local development strategy.Breaking the Cycle of Intergenerational PovertyThe Social Safety Net System Project supports the government’s social protection strategy aimed at protecting poor and vulnerable households and investing in their human capital, with the goal of breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty. The project supports three key instruments:The social register provides all social programs with an efficient, transparent mechanism for targeting the poor and vulnerable. In April 2019, close to 100,000 households were included in this register.The national social transfer program, Tekavoul. In April 2019, around 30,000 extremely poor households benefited from cash transfers and outreach on best practices in the areas of health, hygiene, and early childhood development.The shock-responsive safety net program, Elmaouna. Since 2017, this program has provided support to several thousands of households experiencing food insecurity during the period preceding the harvest.Promoting Women’s Empowerment in the SahelThe Sahel Women's Empowerment and Demographics Project (SWEDD) is a regional initiative that aims to boost the level of empowerment of women and adolescent girls with the goal of expediting demographic transition in the region. The project targets girls aged 10 to 19 who are at a higher risk of early marriage and motherhood and provides them with support through a package of evidence-based, age-appropriate interventions in order to end harmful practices, improve their life skills, keep the girls in school, and boost their earning potential. The Mauritania SWEDD received a total of $17 million in financing, with $2 million coming from the State budget and $15 million from an IDA grant. Based on work completed under the SWEDD, one pillar was devoted to capturing the demographic dividend in the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Shared Prosperity (SCAPP) for 2016–2030. Mauritania has thus launched a communication campaign geared toward behavior change, covering the subjects of girls’ education, women’s economic empowerment, child marriage, and birth spacing, with strong support from Imams and religious leaders as the campaign’s messages are anchored in the context of the position of Islam on these issues.

The ongoing CPF focuses on ensuring that markets work more effectively, establishing the necessary conditions for fiscal and financial stability, and improving service delivery for all Ukrainians.Key EngagementIn the past six years, the Bank has supported the people of Ukraine through a series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs), several new investment operations, a Program-for-Results operation to support the agriculture sector, and two guarantees amounting to approximately US$6 billion aimed at improving critical public services, supporting reforms, and bolstering the private sector.Reform measures aided by the Bank’s policy support operations have promoted good governance, transparency, and accountability in the public sector, as well as stability in the banking sector; a reduction in the cost of doing business; and the effective use of scarce public resources to provide quality public services at a crucial time. These operations also support the authorities in continuing to reform an inefficient and inequitable housing subsidy system while protecting the poor from tariff increases by strengthening social assistance and in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.World Bank investment projects focus on improving basic public services, such as district heating, water and sanitation, health, and social protection, as well as public infrastructure, such as the power transmission networks and national roads. The Bank is also supporting Ukraine through policy advice and technical assistance on formulating and implementing comprehensive structural reforms.In addition to financing several ongoing private sector projects, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) is implementing a large advisory program in the country, working to simplify regulations, improve the investment climate and energy efficiency, boost the completeness of local food producers, help open new markets, and increase access to finance.

        EconomyRecent Economic DevelopmentsUkraine’s economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, GDP declined by 11.4 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the second quarter of 2020, causing GDP to decline to 6.5 percent y-o-y in the first half of the year. However, the negative impact appears to be less severe than initially anticipated, as the full-scale lockdown lasted only from mid-March to early May and has been replaced by an adaptive quarantine that has enabled many services (except passenger transport) to return to normal functioning. Domestic demand has also been supported by a recovery in real wages (up 4.8 percent y-o-y in June compared to -0.4 percent in April) and continued remittance inflows. On the supply side, metals and mining as well as manufacturing have been significantly impacted by weak external demand.Improving terms of trade (due to lower energy prices and higher iron prices) and import compression (amid slower investment activity) contributed to a current account surplus of 4.8 percent of FY GDP in January–July. Remittances have been relatively resilient, down 10 percent y-o-y in the first half of the year, while private capital inflows have also recovered following a brief period of limited outflows in the second quarter. This has helped to reduce external financing needs and rebuild international reserves, which, at US$28.5 billion at end-July, amounted to about 4.6 months of next year’s imports.Since 2019, tight monetary policy, together with controls over public sector wages and current expenditures, have helped to reduce inflation from over 9 percent in 2018 to 2.4 percent in July 2020. This was below the Central Bank’s 5 percent inflation target, enabling it to cut its key policy rate by more than 10 percentage points to 6 percent in June 2020. With inflation expectations averaging 6.7 percent in August, real interest rates are close to zero, and further easing may contribute to inflation pressures in light of more accommodative fiscal policy. Credit demand contracted in the second quarter, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 shock. Banking liquidity remains supported by robust growth in deposits. At 25 percent, (Tier-2) capital buffers are well above regulatory minimums, while nonperforming loan coverage ratios amounted to 96.8 percent in the second quarter of the year.Fiscal pressures in 2020 arose from declining revenues, additional spending related to COVID-19 support measures, and large debt repayments coming due. As a result, a supplementary budget was passed in April that targeted a budget deficit of 7.6 percent of GDP (versus 2.5 percent in the original budget). However, fiscal outcomes in the first half of the year indicate an almost balanced budget, reflecting low expenditure execution and better-than-expected revenue performance, and a deficit outturn of 5 percent of GDP is anticipated in 2020. Significant financing needs during 2020 have been alleviated by official European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing of US$2.7 billion, plus the issuance of a US$1.3 billion 12-year Eurobond in July. Domestic financing remains sufficient to cover domestic debt repayment needs.Moderate poverty (the World Bank’s national methodology for Ukraine) declined from a peak of 26.9 percent during the crisis of 2015 to an estimated 17.8 percent in 2019 due to a reduction in the unemployment rate to 8.6 percent and 9.8 percent growth in real wages. Disposable income grew by 6.6 percent in the first quarter of 2020, but the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to negatively impact employment and real wages and create conditions for an increase in poverty rates.Economic OutlookThe economy is expected to contract by 5.5 percent in 2020, as weakness in the first half of the year is only partly offset by a recovery in domestic demand in the second half and positive contributions from net exports. The baseline assumes a possible re-imposition of containment measures in response to a “second wave” (given that daily reported infections are still increasing) and a slower pace of reforms. Ukraine still expects to raise US$2.9 billion in additional official financing (from the IMF, World Bank, and EU) in the remainder of the year. If these funds are delayed, the Government will have to contain spending or borrow more domestically.Going forward, growth is expected to remain modest at 1.5 percent in 2021, rising to about 3.7 percent by 2023. The outlook depends on the duration of the health crisis and reforms that address bottlenecks to investment and safeguard macroeconomic sustainability. With the recent loss of reform momentum, fixed investment is expected to reach its pre-crisis level only at the end of 2022, and net exports (as import demand revives but the pace of export diversification remains slow) will continue to be a drag on growth in 2021.Poverty based on the international US$5.5 a day poverty line is low in Ukraine and is expected to increase by 0.2 percentage points in 2020. At higher thresholds, the poverty increase will be larger, with poverty based on the World Bank’s national poverty line for Ukraine expected to increase by 2 percentage points. Sustainable economic growth is needed to reduce poverty rates in the medium term.

        All projects in UkraineProject SpotlightServing People, Improving Health Amid the COVID-19 PandemicUkraine’s Serving People, Improving Health Project is one of the World Bank’s largest health care projects in the Europe and Central Asia region, with a total investment of US$350 million. To scale up Ukraine’s health sector reforms and support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank approved US$135 million in additional financing on April 27, 2020, to the initial investment of US$215 million.This additional financing will help Ukraine to upgrade up to 40 hospital emergency departments and stroke units, enabling hospitals to perform complicated medical procedures using high-tech equipment and appropriate treatment protocols. It will also help train thousands of Ukrainian doctors in the provision of modern medical services.The project provides US$35 million for COVID-19 emergency response activities. These funds will be used to buy essential materials and equipment for the country’s response to the crisis, provide much-needed training for medical personnel, and support the communication of critical public information. It will also cover the reimbursement of expenditures of providers of health care for patients with COVID-19.The Serving People, Improving Health Project supports important health reforms and assists in the renovation of hospitals and rural and urban health ambulatories, the purchase of modern equipment, and improvements in the efficiency and quality of health services. The expected improvements in service delivery focus on primary and secondary prevention, early detection, and the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and COVID-19.

        Zimbabwe is facing an economic crisis, further worsened by COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. In 2019, Zimbabwe was hit by severe drought and Cyclone Idai, that coupled with shortages of foreign currency led to double-digit contraction of agriculture, electricity, and water production and pushed more than half of the population into food insecurity. Policy missteps—lack of effective fiscal-monetary-forex policy coordination and significant quasi-fiscal activities by the Central Bank—undermined the de-dollarization effort and resulted in a rapid depreciation of the local currency and high inflationary pressures.   High inflation eroded disposable incomes of population and depressed domestic demand. Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 8.1% in 2019 and the recession is projected to continue in 2020 due to persistent climate shocks and domestic vulnerabilities worsened by COVID-19. The pandemic has negatively affected exports, tourism, and manufacturing, deepening the economic crisis and poverty. As uncertainty about the duration and severity of the virus spread remains high, GDP is expected to contract in 2020 between 5% under the baseline scenario and 10% in the low case scenario.    Inflation reached triple digit levels in 2019, and is projected to remain high in 2020 as COVID-19 disrupts production and trade. Inflation surged to 521% year-on-year in December 2019, fueled by a rapid exchange rate depreciation, poor harvests, and reduction of subsidies on fuel and electricity. Food prices increased by 725%, resulting in a severe loss of purchasing power for the poor. Continued local currency depreciation, disruption of production and trade as a result of COVID-19 are likely to fuel inflationary pressures in 2020.   The government introduced a new inflation rate in June 2020 based on blending US$ and ZWL$ (local currency) prices. The blended annual inflation rate stood at 457.2% in June 2020 while the unblended (usual) annual inflation rate stood at 737.3% down from 786% in May 2020. With limited access to external financing and growing humanitarian needs due to COVID-19 and persistent climate shocks, the government may resort to monetary financing, stoking further inflation.  Human Capital Despite increases in social protection spending, including repayment of arrears on important social programs, most extremely poor citizens remained unprotected, and their numbers are rising.  Education and health spending budgets, which have a large salary component, were eroded by inflation, worsening human capital outcomes and jeopardizing opportunities for future generations. On the back of sizable financing needs and deteriorating revenue generation capacity, the pandemic has increased expenditure pressures. Efforts to scale up health care financing and provide social protection to urban beneficiaries who are most exposed to the lockdown are ongoing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 5.6% of GDP.  Development Challenges  Poverty levels increased sharply in 2019 and are projected to worsen further in 2020. In 2019, the number of extreme poor is estimated to have reached 6.6 million, double the level in 2011. A substantial decline in agriculture production and high food prices increased food insecurity, with close to 50% of the population being food insecure in 2019. Extreme poverty reached 40% of the population in 2019, up from 33.4% in 2017, with urban poverty rising faster (from 4% to 10%) than rural poverty.  The poverty levels are projected to rise further in 2020 due to continuing economic contraction and loss of employment and income, exacerbated by the restrictions on mobility, inflationary pressures and drought conditions. The number of extreme poor is projected to increase from 6.6 million in 2019 to 7.6 million in 2020 under the baseline scenario and to eight million under the low case scenario.

On the back of sizable financing needs and deteriorating revenue generation capacity, the pandemic has increased expenditure pressures. Efforts to scale up health care financing and provide social protection to urban beneficiaries who are most exposed to the lockdown are ongoing. As a result, the fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 5.6% of GDP.  Development Challenges  Poverty levels increased sharply in 2019 and are projected to worsen further in 2020. In 2019, the number of extreme poor is estimated to have reached 6.6 million, double the level in 2011. A substantial decline in agriculture production and high food prices increased food insecurity, with close to 50% of the population being food insecure in 2019. Extreme poverty reached 40% of the population in 2019, up from 33.4% in 2017, with urban poverty rising faster (from 4% to 10%) than rural poverty.  The poverty levels are projected to rise further in 2020 due to continuing economic contraction and loss of employment and income, exacerbated by the restrictions on mobility, inflationary pressures and drought conditions. The number of extreme poor is projected to increase from 6.6 million in 2019 to 7.6 million in 2020 under the baseline scenario and to eight million under the low case scenario.

        World Bank Group (WBG) assistance to Zimbabwe totaled $1.6 billion between 1980 and 2000. Since 2000, direct lending has been suspended because of non-payment of arrears.  Due to the arrears, the WBG is providing support to Zimbabwe and remains fully engaged in Zimbabwe through a number of trust funds (TFs), including the multi-donor Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF), its predecessor, the Multi-Donor Health Results Innovation Trust Fund- Global Financing Facility (HIRTF-GFF), the State and Peacebuilding Fund, and the Cooperation in International Waters. The support has been bolstered by an exceptional allocation of $72 million from the International Development Association Crisis Window Response for the Zimbabwe Idai Recovery Project, which aims to address the early and medium-term resilient disaster recovery needs of the country’s cyclone-affected people.  The project became effective in July 2019 and was formally launched in Harare on September 2, 2019. Given Zimbabwe’s non-accrual status with the Bank, the financing underscores the unprecedented humanitarian crisis caused by Cyclone Idai. The Global Financing Facility also supports a Health Sector Development Support Project and  results-based financing (RBF) approaches in the health sector ($53 million) to improve maternal and child health in both rural and urban areas. Under ZIMREF, the following programs are under implementation: A results-based budgeting Technical Assistance (TA) program ($1.3 million) supports the implementation of program-based budgeting across all central government line ministries. The TA also supports the Education and Health components. A Capital Budgets TA ($4.3 million) supports the improvement of state-owned enterprise governance, public investment planning and management, and the review of the transport sector institutional framework with support to aviation and road tolling reforms. Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation Technical Assistance ($1.9 million) supports statistical capacity building with the Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey. Public Procurement Modernization Project ($2 million) supports the alignment of the public procurement legislation and institutional framework to the Constitution. Public Financial Management Enhancement Project ($10 million) to improve financial reporting, internal controls, fiscal transparency and accountability in government finances. National Water Project ($10 million) to improve access and quality of water and sanitation services in seven small town growth centers, improve water resources planning, and support the reforms in the water sector nationally. The Business Environment, Financial Sector and Investment Policy TA ($3.2 million) to improve the business climate for the private sector, especially for micro enterprises, SMEs, and agricultural smallholders. A Climate Change TA ($1.5 million) to strengthen the capacity of the government to integrate climate change into investment planning in forestry, agriculture, and the water/energy nexus. Last Updated: Aug 15, 2020"

        Zimbabwe is facing an economic crisis, further worsened by COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. In 2019, Zimbabwe was hit by severe drought and Cyclone Idai, that coupled with shortages of foreign currency led to double-digit contraction of agriculture, electricity, and water production and pushed more than half of the population into food insecurity. Policy missteps—lack of effective fiscal-monetary-forex policy coordination and significant quasi-fiscal activities by the Central Bank—undermined the de-dollarization effort and resulted in a rapid depreciation of the local currency and high inflationary pressures.   High inflation eroded disposable incomes of population and depressed domestic demand. Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 8.1% in 2019 and the recession is projected to continue in 2020 due to persistent climate shocks and domestic vulnerabilities worsened by COVID-19. The pandemic has negatively affected exports, tourism, and manufacturing, deepening the economic crisis and poverty. As uncertainty about the duration and severity of the virus spread remains high, GDP is expected to contract in 2020 between 5% under the baseline scenario and 10% in the low case scenario.    Inflation reached triple digit levels in 2019, and is projected to remain high in 2020 as COVID-19 disrupts production and trade. Inflation surged to 521% year-on-year in December 2019, fueled by a rapid exchange rate depreciation, poor harvests, and reduction of subsidies on fuel and electricity. Food prices increased by 725%, resulting in a severe loss of purchasing power for the poor. Continued local currency depreciation, disruption of production and trade as a result of COVID-19 are likely to fuel inflationary pressures in 2020.   The government introduced a new inflation rate in June 2020 based on blending US$ and ZWL$ (local currency) prices.

        Human Capital  The Health Results Innovation Global Financing Facility has helped:  More than 800,000 women receive antenatal care services through at least one visit at supported facilities since inception More than 100,000 pregnant mothers have delivered in the facilities on an annual basis  As of February 2020, the cumulative number of births attended by skilled health personnel for all participating rural and urban districts is over 870,000 and a total of 728,647 children completed the primary course on immunization since inception  Health facilities undergo routine quality of care assessments, which have shown improvements in structural and process quality with current average quality scores ranging between 80% and 85%, therefore favorably comparing to previous averages that fell below 75%.  The impact evaluation of the program confirmed the approach resulted in faster rates of improvements in key maternal and child health indicators e.g there was a 13% improvement in the in-facility delivery rate and a 12% improvement in postnatal care in results-based-financing districts, compared to those that had not yet started the approach.  The project is increasing maternal and child health intervention in rural districts serving over 4.5 million people and expanding community involvement. Technical and Analytical (TA) Work With support from the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF), significant achievements have been achieved including: The introduction of program-based budgets by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. The program began in 2017 with three pilot ministries, and to date it has been scaled up the national budget being produced in PBB format. The Health Sector component of the Results-based Budgeting TA supported efforts by the government and other development partners in the production of the Zimbabwe National Health Financing Policy and National Health Financing Strategy. The Education component awaits the finalization of the Teaching Professions Bill and the launch of the ICT policy in Education.  ZIMREF provided support to the government in the development of the Public Entities Corporate Governance Act to enhance corporate governance, transparency and accountability clearing the way for improved performance in public entities.  The Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation TA has updated and refined the Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey while supporting the Zimbabwe Statistical Agency to modernize data processing and introduce a statutory instrument to allow for anonymization of micro-data for policy analysis  A procurement project has contributed to the Modernization of Procurement laws, regulations and production of a cutting-edge e-Government procurement strategy that has the potential to change the landscape once rolled out. Through a public financial management project, reporting has been enhanced through the consolidation of two annual financial statements and improved coverage of internal audit in Central Government with 87% of the audit workplan completed. Through a water project, availability and quality has been improved in three towns of Zimunya, Lupane and Guruve. Once the scope of works is complete, a total of 16,922 people will have benefitted. More than 20 significant administrative, regulatory and legislative reforms to improve the cost of doing business leading to a 3.4% improvement in the Doing Business Index supported by the Business Environment Financial Sector Investment Policy TA.

        In 2014, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF), a country-specific umbrella-type multi-donor trust fund that contributes to strengthening Zimbabwe’s systems for reconstruction and development. ZIMREF is the key instrument for implementing the Bank’s Third Interim Strategy Note for Zimbabwe. So far, the trust fund has received more than $43 million from Denmark, the European Union, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank’s State and Peace Building Fund. The Health Results Innovation Trust Fund Global Financing Facility’s grant of $53 million complements Zimbabwe’s ongoing Health Sector Development Project which supports the introduction of Results-Based Financing in rural and low-income clinics, the piloting of voucher programs in urban clinics, and quality intervention throughout. The government’s contribution is $18.2 million. Cordaid is the implementing partner. Development partners also include the European Union, the African Union Development Bank, the Zimbabwe River Authority, and Embassy of Sweden, which are funding the Kariba Dam Rehabilitation Project.

        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSThe global COVID-19 shock, tensions with Russia on crude oil supply terms, and lower global energy prices were a drag on growth, with the economy contracting by 1.3 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) between January and August 2020. In addition, following a contested outcome in the August 9 presidential elections, investor confidence and economic activities have been further impacted by political unrest.Falling remittances, a weaker Russian ruble, and heightened household foreign exchange demand led to a 26 percent depreciation of the Belarusian ruble relative to the U.S. dollar in January–August. Banking liquidity pressures have increased as deposit withdrawals have accelerated, with foreign exchange deposits falling 6 percent month-on-month in August. International reserves have fallen 20 percent since January (by US$1.4 billion in August alone) and have reached roughly US$7.5 billion (fewer than three months of imports).Public and publicly guaranteed debt amounted to 43.3 percent of GDP. External financing needs have been partially alleviated by a US$1.25 billion Eurobond issuance and by US$145 million in bonds issued on the Russian market, as well as by the restructuring of loan terms for the construction of a nuclear power plant. Real household income continued to grow in the first half of 2020 on account of increased wages and pensions. The national poverty rate fell 0.3 percentage points in 2018 and declined further to reach 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 2020.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKThe economy is expected to contract by 2.8 percent in 2020, reflecting the drag from COVID-19 and the economic repercussions of increased political tension. The recession is expected to deepen in 2021, reflecting a significant retrenchment in household spending and investment demand due to heightened uncertainty and the lack of fiscal and monetary policy space to support the economy.Long-standing structural challenges related to the growing number of loss-making SOEs, the high degree of dollarization, and external vulnerabilities are expected to weigh on the recovery thereafter. The outlook assumes fiscal consolidation, which is necessary to prevent the twin fiscal and current account deficits—reflecting the impact of the withdrawal of Russian energy subsidies—from widening to unsustainable levels and to contain financing pressures related to large debt repayments that are coming due.The recession will negatively affect household welfare unless targeted cash transfers are expanded, as other support instruments will be constrained by the limited fiscal space. Poverty impacts are expected to be more significant at higher thresholds, as the last recession of 2015–16 was associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the national poverty rate and a 15 percentage point increase in the share of the population below the minimum consumption budget.

A national program objective is to improve the quality of secondary education and to optimize the network of general secondary education institutions.A World Bank–financed project is helping by:Modernizing schools in rural areas and small towns through the rehabilitation of school facilities and the provision of the necessary laboratory equipment for physics, chemistry, biology, and information technology classes (64 schools have already been modernized and 236 schools are next in line)Piloting and disseminating modern approaches to school learning environmentsModernizing management of the education sector and bringing it in line with international best practices by introducing an Integrated Education Management System and conducting training for school principals and educational professionalsIncreasing the efficiency of the system of evaluating student learning by ramping up national and international assessments, including the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). The availability of the PISA 2018 results is now allowing Belarus to adequately assess the quality of its education program relative to other countries and to identify any problems with regard to equal access to quality educationIn total, the project will improve learning conditions for 65,000 students from all over Belarus.A school in the city of Voronovo (Grodno oblast), renovated with support from the World Bank project. Now, more than 1,000 students have access to modern physics and chemistry classrooms, computers, a library with places for individual training, classes for after school extension for 80 children, and a modern gym. A barrier-free environment has also been established, providing special lifts and toilets. ________________________________Briefs on active projects in Belarus (PDF)

        The COVID-19 pandemic exposed Brazil to an unprecedented health and economic challenge. To contain the pandemic, Brazil implemented social measures to slow the spread of the virus and contain its impact on the health system capacity, which is uneven across the country. The pandemic found Brazil with a fragile recovery and limited fiscal policy space following the 2015/16 recession.The pandemic, and the health policy response to it, have resulted into a sharp decline of external demand and affect domestic demand and constraint supply. In the second quarter, the economy contracted by a historic 9.7 percent.  As a result, Brazil GDP is projected to decline in 2020, followed by rebound in 2021 and 2022.The pandemic has brought uncertainties to the macroeconomic policy framework, especially in the fiscal scenario, which translate into downside risks, calling for strong fiscal consolidation and adoption of structural reforms in 2021. To protect the most vulnerable people, the Government has put forward a large, timely, targeted and time bound fiscal package focused on social assistance. The cost of this package is estimated at BRL 713.4 billion (US$135.4 billion), or 10.4 percent of GDP.Lower tax revenues from a weakened economy and the associated fiscal measures adopted are expected to increase the primary deficit of the general government in 2020. Despite historically low interest rates, the pandemic aggravated the challenges to stabilize public debt, that is likely to surpass 90 percent of GDP in 2020. To regain lost ground, it will be critical to ensure that emergency measures remain temporary and that long-term fiscal sustainability remains anchored in Brazil’s expenditure rule.Following the dramatic decreases in domestic and international demand resulting from the pandemic during the first half of the year, Brazil is projected to fall into its deepest recession on record. While activities normalize, the crisis created a steep drop in labor income and employment, increasing the likelihood of falling into poverty among low-salary workers and informal workers – two groups where vulnerable groups were overrepresented before the COVID-19 pandemic.The unemployment rate reached 13.3 percent in June 2020 (14.9 percent for women), the highest rate in the past three years. However, due to the broad social response from government to support private consumption, sectors like industry and commerce show a partial rebound, while the services sector’s recovery remains heterogeneous across subsectors.COVID-19 hit as Brazil was still recovering from its 2014-16 recession. Economic recovery remained weak since the peak of the recession in 2015-2016, with 1.3 percent real GDP growth recorded in 2017 and 2018 and 1.1 percent GDP growth in 2019. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Brazil’s poorest were still recovering from the 2014-2016 recession, with the income of the poorest 40 percent remaining below the pre-2014 crisis level. As of 2018, 19.9 percent of the population lived on less than US$5.50 per day (2011 PPP), including 9.3 million people on less than US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP) – the global reference for extreme poverty.[1]The pandemic will curb incomes across the entire income distribution. However, due to the AE, poverty is projected to decrease in 2020. Yet this drop is likely to be reversed as the emergency measures expire and the labor market is not able to fully absorb the unemployed.Despite the recession, Brazil’s macroeconomic framework is expected to remain broadly adequate, albeit with substantial downside risks, calling for strong fiscal consolidation and adoption of structural reforms, some of which have already started to remove critical bottlenecks for productivity growth. Brazil has suffered low productivity growth over the last two decades due to, among other factors, a cumbersome business environment, distortionary tax system, inadequate business support programs and a domestic market relatively closed to trade and external competition.Brazil also lacks adequate investment in infrastructure (2.1 percent of GDP on average between 2000 and 2013), resulting in a deterioration of the infrastructure stock that creates acute bottlenecks for production. With limited fiscal space and a dwindling demographic bonus, accelerating productivity growth remains key to sustain economic growth. To this end, the federal government aims to approve new legislations for key infrastructure sectors (energy, telecom, railways). A new legal framework for the water and sanitation sector was recently approved in Congress.The government is also opening markets to private sector participation through concessions (airports), foreign investment (air passenger transport) and PPPs (e.g. ports). On the trade side, to foster Brazil’s integration in the global economy the government has concluded new trade agreements, starting with the Mercosur/EU and Mercosur/EFTA agreements recently concluded and on-going negotiations with Canada, Korea and Singapore.The Central Bank is leading a reform program to create key instruments (positive credit database, credit guarantees, electronic invoicing credit, etc.) to foster competition in the financial markets. Through the tax reform, the government expects to improve the business environment by making the system simpler and less distorting and bringing more judicial safety.[1] Recently published estimates suggest only a marginal improvement in 2019. Data for internationally comparable poverty rates for 2019 are not yet available.

        In 2016, the World Bank conducted a Systematic Country Diagnosis (Systematic Country Diagnostic / SCD) of Brazil, which sought to determine the main challenges that the country must face in its path towards inclusive and sustainable growth.Based on SCD findings and the feedback gathered in the dissemination phase, a new  Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period of 2018-2023 was produced. This strategy is based on three pillars:1)      Fiscal sustainability and improved service delivery. This pillar focuses on fiscal adjustment support at the federal and subnational levels, including pension and social protection systems. It also addresses greater efficiency in public service delivery, especially in education and health.2)      Productivity growth and investments by the private sector. Objectives under this pillar relate to efforts to reduce the regulatory barriers that undermine competitiveness, as well as to correct distortions in the credit market and mobilize investments in infrastructure.3)      Inclusive and sustainable development. The objective here is to support Brazil's ambitious Nationally Defined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement by promoting global partnerships.The upcoming Performance and Learning Review (PLR), to be delivered to the Board in 2021 (tbc), will aim to update the CPF and align WBG support with the evolving country context (including in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic) and government priorities. It will further benefit from consultations with all relevant stakeholders at subnational and national levels.

        The COVID-19 pandemic exposed Brazil to an unprecedented health and economic challenge. To contain the pandemic, Brazil implemented social measures to slow the spread of the virus and contain its impact on the health system capacity, which is uneven across the country. The pandemic found Brazil with a fragile recovery and limited fiscal policy space following the 2015/16 recession.The pandemic, and the health policy response to it, have resulted into a sharp decline of external demand and affect domestic demand and constraint supply. In the second quarter, the economy contracted by a historic 9.7 percent.  As a result, Brazil GDP is projected to decline in 2020, followed by rebound in 2021 and 2022.The pandemic has brought uncertainties to the macroeconomic policy framework, especially in the fiscal scenario, which translate into downside risks, calling for strong fiscal consolidation and adoption of structural reforms in 2021. To protect the most vulnerable people, the Government has put forward a large, timely, targeted and time bound fiscal package focused on social assistance. The cost of this package is estimated at BRL 713.4 billion (US$135.4 billion), or 10.4 percent of GDP.Lower tax revenues from a weakened economy and the associated fiscal measures adopted are expected to increase the primary deficit of the general government in 2020. Despite historically low interest rates, the pandemic aggravated the challenges to stabilize public debt, that is likely to surpass 90 percent of GDP in 2020. To regain lost ground, it will be critical to ensure that emergency measures remain temporary and that long-term fiscal sustainability remains anchored in Brazil’s expenditure rule.Following the dramatic decreases in domestic and international demand resulting from the pandemic during the first half of the year, Brazil is projected to fall into its deepest recession on record. While activities normalize, the crisis created a steep drop in labor income and employment, increasing the likelihood of falling into poverty among low-salary workers and informal workers – two groups where vulnerable groups were overrepresented before the COVID-19 pandemic.The unemployment rate reached 13.3 percent in June 2020 (14.9 percent for women), the highest rate in the past three years. However, due to the broad social response from government to support private consumption, sectors like industry and commerce show a partial rebound, while the services sector’s recovery remains heterogeneous across subsectors.COVID-19 hit as Brazil was still recovering from its 2014-16 recession. Economic recovery remained weak since the peak of the recession in 2015-2016, with 1.3 percent real GDP growth recorded in 2017 and 2018 and 1.1 percent GDP growth in 2019. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Brazil’s poorest were still recovering from the 2014-2016 recession, with the income of the poorest 40 percent remaining below the pre-2014 crisis level. As of 2018, 19.9 percent of the population lived on less than US$5.50 per day (2011 PPP), including 9.3 million people on less than US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP) – the global reference for extreme poverty.[1]The pandemic will curb incomes across the entire income distribution. However, due to the AE, poverty is projected to decrease in 2020. Yet this drop is likely to be reversed as the emergency measures expire and the labor market is not able to fully absorb the unemployed.Despite the recession, Brazil’s macroeconomic framework is expected to remain broadly adequate, albeit with substantial downside risks, calling for strong fiscal consolidation and adoption of structural reforms, some of which have already started to remove critical bottlenecks for productivity growth. Brazil has suffered low productivity growth over the last two decades due to, among other factors, a cumbersome business environment, distortionary tax system, inadequate business support programs and a domestic market relatively closed to trade and external competition.Brazil also lacks adequate investment in infrastructure (2.1 percent of GDP on average between 2000 and 2013), resulting in a deterioration of the infrastructure stock that creates acute bottlenecks for production. With limited fiscal space and a dwindling demographic bonus, accelerating productivity growth remains key to sustain economic growth. To this end, the federal government aims to approve new legislations for key infrastructure sectors (energy, telecom, railways). A new legal framework for the water and sanitation sector was recently approved in Congress.The government is also opening markets to private sector participation through concessions (airports), foreign investment (air passenger transport) and PPPs (e.g. ports). On the trade side, to foster Brazil’s integration in the global economy the government has concluded new trade agreements, starting with the Mercosur/EU and Mercosur/EFTA agreements recently concluded and on-going negotiations with Canada, Korea and Singapore.The Central Bank is leading a reform program to create key instruments (positive credit database, credit guarantees, electronic invoicing credit, etc.) to foster competition in the financial markets. Through the tax reform, the government expects to improve the business environment by making the system simpler and less distorting and bringing more judicial safety.[1] Recently published estimates suggest only a marginal improvement in 2019. Data for internationally comparable poverty rates for 2019 are not yet available.

        Brazil’s project portfolio spans several areas of the economy, civil society and the environment, and has had significant positive impacts on people's lives - including, especially, the most vulnerable. See below some highlights of the World Bank's operations in Brazil, divided by the three pillars of the CPF.Pillar 1 - Fiscal sustainability and improved service deliveryEducationConsidering international standardized learning tests, the quality of education in Brazil has been improving slowly over the past 15 years. However, despite this moderate progress, learning levels remain behind countries comparable to Brazil. This challenge is illustrated by the fact that in 2019, in Brazil, 4 out of 10 youths by the age of 19 did not finish high school. Or additionally: a significant share of children up to 3 years old do not have access to early childhood education. Altogether, these facts impose key challenges to economic and social development.In this context, the Bank has engaged consistently to mitigate the challenges through investment projects that provide not only financial support but, in parallel, augments local skills by sharing global experience and knowledge. One example is a federal project led by the Education Global Practice comprehending all 27 subnational governments, and an additional 5 multi-sector projects, in which the education component plays a key role (in multiple states and 2 municipalities). Most generally, theis program also include a rich set of analytical activities (including impact evaluations and assessments) and technical support.Among subnational projects, the Salvador Social Multi-sector Projects I, and the recent second phase, aim at improving the efficiency of social service delivery in the Municipality of Salvador, one of the largest yet poorest urban area of Brazil, with 50% of its population below poverty line and 80% of afro-descendants, while integrating a strong COVID-19 focus in the short and longer-term. The projects support innovations to consolidate and accelerate the acquisition of basic skills and prevent dropouts, as well as the provision of emotional support to teachers, students and families.HealthThe Salvador Social Multi-sector Project has been improving delivery of public health services through the expansion of the primary health care (PHC) coverage, and the consolidation of secondary and tertiary care under municipal’s governance. These investments helped the municipality improve results in the other levels of health care, as demonstrated by the decrease in the percentage of low risk patients in the Intermediate Emergency Care Units (Unidades de Pronto Atendimento, UPAs). Notable results have also been achieved in the use of technologies to improve health care management, as evidenced by some of the Project’s indicators.As of December 2019, the number of municipal health facilities with an operational electronic medical record system had increased from a baseline of 0 to 102 units; the number of municipal health units with health services provision available within the municipal regulation system (Sistema Vida+) had increased from 30 to 145; and the number of municipal primary care units with a management system installed had increased from 30 to 138. The Bank has approved, in September 2020, a second phase to this project, which will continue expanding coverage and strengthening the delivery of social services in the municipality, as well as help with the COVID-19 response.To keep pace with the country's changing health profile, the World Bank has promoted health projects focused on chronic diseases, such as the Piauí Pillars of Growth and Social Inclusion Project, which has been expanding access to specialized diagnosis and treatment with five new treatment centers, covering half the state's population, and other complementary investments in clinical protocols and training of health professionals. The operation also supports the implementation of the new Intelligence Center for Tropical, Emerging and Neglected Diseases (CIATEN), a cutting-edge institution in Brazil, dedicated to research (observatory), epidemiological information, and training of health professionals. Approximately US$ 4.5 million of loan proceeds have been allocated to respond to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.The Rio Grande do Norte Regional Development and Governance Project  has been improving health services aimed at women and children by increasing the number of maternity wards and functional beds for newborns. It also supports increased emergency health units in the state and improved capacities to cope with cancer and to diagnose various diseases in two new laboratories. The project has allocated about US$5 million to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic through the acquisition of medical and personal protective equipment.Pillar 2 - Productivity growth and investments by the private sectorAgricultureThe Bank's programs in agriculture and rural development support the states in promoting and / or strengthening productive economic activities that help increase the quality of life and income of family farmers and the access to technical assistance and technological innovations aimed at the adoption of environmentally-sustainable practices and techniques and improved productivity. Innovative projects empower local communities in poor regions of the Northeast, as well as in other parts of the country (North, South-East and South), to invest in improving the quality of products and thereby increase access to institutional and private markets - mainly through collective channels, such as producer associations and cooperatives.The projects also invest in complementary infrastructure to support agricultural activities, such as: agro-logistics, alternative energy sources, water supply and basic sanitation. One such example, the Productive Bahia Project has supported strategic investments in the various links of identified value chains, as well as in the formation of productive alliances between producers and private companies to enable the necessary investments to meet market requirements - both in terms of quality and quantity - while favoring experience above all else. This is the case of organic cocoa producers in southern Bahia. Potential buyers and visitors to the region can experience a day in the countryside and purchase almonds and several cocoa products (chocolate, nibs, etc.) when they visit production areas. This approach also benefits the recovery of the Atlantic Forest, by adopting agroforestry practices and systems and several other practices that increase production and strengthen climatic resilience. Inclusive, resilient and sustainable citiesThe World Bank recognizes the importance of Brazilian cities. Concentrating more than 85% of the country's population, they are engines of economic growth and development. However, these cities also present high concentration of poverty, as well as drastic socio-spatial inequalities, all exacerbated by the rising frequency and intensity of extreme climate-related events, which affect the poor and vulnerable in a disproportionate manner.The World Bank's support for promoting inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities comes in different ways. There is the traditional one-on-one engagement with municipalities to address their specific and multidimensional challenges related to planning, formulation and implementation of public policies, including the provision and maintenance of infrastructure and services at the local level. In Fortaleza, for example, a project under implementation benefits more than 300 thousand people through a set of urban and environmental improvements, with expected results on the transformation of the entire western (and less favored) portion of the city. This project comprises of the implementation of a 10 km long linear urban park; the reduction of point-source pollution along the coastline; and the increase in the municipality’s own source revenue capacity.But the World Bank has also been investing in innovative ways of providing municipalities with financing to support integrated projects for urban resilience. A recently approved operation granted access to a World Bank loan, through which the Regional Development Bank for the Far South (Banco Regional de Desenvolvimento do Extremo Sul - BRDE) will be able to act as a financial intermediary and lend to small and medium-sized municipalities in southern Brazil interested in promoting the resilience agenda. This project comprises of a specific credit line to finance disaster risk management and mitigation projects (addressing events, such as floods, landslides and coastal erosion).Gender                         The active promotion of gender equality is an essential component of the World Bank's strategy in Brazil and has expanded considerably since 2010. In 14 states, World Bank Group projects incorporate gender components by requiring meaningful gender-sensitive consultations; supporting and developing guidances towards combating harassment in public spaces and public transport and against domestic violence; improving response services; promoting economic inclusion, and improving health services and / or reducing of teen pregnancy. In the municipality of Salvador, the Bank is supporting the strengthening of the institutional and technical capacity of the municipal social assistance system to address and prevent GBV, through a grant, by promoting a series of trainings and workshops targeted both at professionals and users of the social assistance network. Complementary actions will be taken in the framework of the Salvador II Project: the development of intersectoral protocol, continuous training workshops targeted at public agents involved in the provision of services to survivors, and communication strategies targeted at GBV prevention and studies on the social and economic impacts of GBV in the municipality.In the state of Piauí, the Bank is supporting the strengthening and capacity building of the state’s policy bodies for women. Furthermore, in the state’s capital, Teresina, the Bank has supported the development of a diagnostic on the GBV situation in the municipality and has promoted a series of training aiming at strengthening the services offered to victims and survivors.In 2020, the Bank also established a partnership with the National Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights in the development of a series of knowledge exchange activities and analytical and advisory work to strengthen protection systems for survivors of domestic violence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of these efforts resulted in the publication of a technical note on Addressing Violence against Women (VAW) under COVID-19 in Brazil.TransportThe Brazilian transport portfolio has provided support to mobilize greater investment in infrastructure to improve services, including through PPPs and various activities such as: i) supporting the concession of more than 2,000km of federal roads to the private sector, improving the efficiency of road maintenance for passenger and cargo trucks and reducing logistics costs; ii) supporting the concession of Lines 8 and 9 of the suburban rail in São Paulo, the concession of the federal passenger railway network privatization process in Belo Horizonte, and that of a new Bus Rapid Transit Systems in the Itajaí River Bed Region. The transport projects also support the implementation of the public investments in three major passenger rail PPPs, the São Paulo Metro Line 4, São Paulo Metro Line 5 and the Suburban Rail in Rio de Janeiro, Supervia.These projects were pioneers in the field and allowed for strong private participation in sectors previously only invested in by the public sector. With these investments, high quality transport services are being provided with private financing, improving people’s accessibility to jobs, health and leisure, reducing travel times, and deeply impacting more than 3 million people a day, mostly poor, who were previously subject to “super commutes”.Pillar 3 - Inclusive and sustainable developmentEnvironmentFew countries have ecosystems as rich, diverse and critical to the well-being of their populations as Brazil. The country is home to one-third of the world’s tropical rain forests, twenty percent of the world’s freshwater supply and the Cerrado region - a tropical savannah with the world’s highest rate of biodiversity. A significant part of Brazil’s economy relies on the use of natural resources. Brazilian forests are also huge reservoirs of carbon and an important asset for maintaining the global climate balance.In recent years, Brazil has improved its environmental laws and implemented several initiatives to combat climate change, with significant reductions in emissions. The Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program covers 60 million hectares of protected areas. It is estimated that the impact of ARPA alone will be enough to avoid the emission of 430 million tons of carbon by 2030. Another example is the Marine Protected Areas Program, a pioneering initiative set to triple the amount of marine protected areas in the coastal regions of Brazil. The Amazon Sustainable Landscapes Program (begun in June 2018) combines biodiversity protection with the recovery of degraded areas to ensure the connectivity of Amazonian ecosystems and to support the sustainable development of the region.In Brazil, the World Bank is supporting the government in better managing and conserving the Cerrado , the second largest biome in South America, which is being deforested twice as quickly as the Amazon, due to land clearing for agriculture and cattle ranching. The Cerrado is a driver of economic growth and is essential for food security, biodiversity conservation, water regulation and carbon sequestration. Investments underway are addressing drivers of deforestation by making agricultural production more sustainable, providing monitoring and information, and building capacity to detect, prevent and fight forest fires. Results to date include:20,025 farmers have been trained in low carbon emission agricultural practices: 9,227 producers have enrolled in training/technical assistance + 1,908 additional people have received technical assistance on properties + 8,644 people participated in technological reference units days + 246 trained technicians.93,844 hectares increase of areas under low carbon emission agricultural practices (sum of 42,588 ha for training group and 51,256 ha for training + technical assistance group).The indirect effect, computed as area under indirect interventions in harrowing and seeding as well as other interventions, is 151,204 ha for the CAP group and 133,464 ha for training and technical assistance.190,072 landholding, totalizing about 35.5 million hectares have been enrolled in the National Rural Environmental cadaster system (SICAR) and, as a result, are adopting sustainable land management practices.Thirty-two Traditional Communities’ Territories, encompassing a total area of 94,897 hectares, were georeferenced, and 2,506 families there gained Agricultural Environmental Cadastre (CAR) registries, a majority of which, granted to women.DGM Brazil is supporting sixty-four subprojects, in which 36 involve indigenous communities; 12 comprises quilombolas; 12 are in traditional communities; and four are institutional subprojects.20 Cerrado biome’s Indigenous People and Traditional Communities representatives supported in conservation and other REDD+ related processes at regional, national and global level.11 states (Tocantins, Bahia, Piaui, Sao Paulo, Paraná, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Maranhão), and the Ministry of Environment  being supported with improved environmental and land planning management systems.Biennial deforestation ratings, available for the period of 2000-2012 and annual deforestation ratings, available for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, were made public. The data is available at: fttp://www.obt.inpe.br/cerrado/ or http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/app/dashboard/deforestation/biomes/cerrado/incrementsWater Resources ManagementBrazil has suffered from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. They increase the country's vulnerability to natural disasters and represent a disproportionately high threat to the livelihoods of the poor. Specifically in the water sector - where climate events have a major impact - the Bank has been working to improve the country's capacity to better manage climate-related risks, by means of improved monitoring, analysis, planning, preparation, mitigation and response capacities. This support occurs at the national and subnational levels, and leverages many of the World Bank's financing, technical assistance and analytical studies.Ongoing projects in the water sector incorporate these elements – including in the states of Pernambuco, Espírito Santo, São Paulo (including the Metropolitan region), Paraíba, and Ceará. The World Bank has also provided technical assistance in the creation of the country's first Drought Monitor, a tool that enables the nine Brazilian semi-arid states to manage the phenomenon and mitigate the social and economic impacts of droughts.The World Bank's support of sustainable development in Brazil aims to improve quality of life through integrated approaches to rural development, better local services in urban and rural areas and contributions to the efficient management of the country's natural resources.As part of its commitment to helping improve the quality of life of poor rural populations, the World Bank's rural development projects include water resources management components, including the Pernambuco Water Sustainability Project, which targets populations of the Capibaribe river and the metropolitan region of Recife. The World Bank has also provided technical assistance in the formulation of the country's first Drought Monitor, a tool that enables the nine Brazilian semi-arid states to manage the phenomenon and mitigate the social and economic impacts of droughts.TransportOne of the main priorities of Brazil, an 85 percent urbanized country, is to provide more inclusive and sustainable urban services, as well as to promote socio economic development to small rural producers and vulnerable groups. Brazil still suffers from low logistics performance, with stagnant road infrastructure since the 90’s. In addition to that, the transport sector is a large contributor of GHG emissions, coming particularly from roads (86% from transport emissions come from roads). Moreover, Brazil’s numbers of road deaths are among the worsts in LAC (23 deaths/100k inhabitants per year) and road accidents cost around 4% of its GDP.Besides the rail projects cited above (under Pillar 2), the World Bank promotes the development of inclusive, green and technological BRT corridors in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Itajaí River Bed region, improving urban mobility with a focus on reducing GHG emissions, improving road safety, and increasing accessibility of the poor to jobs . Public transport, besides being the main mean of travel of the poor and women, offer 100% climate co-benefits, and might significantly reduce air pollution. At the federal level, the WB is supporting the technological transition to electric mobility by enhancing city’s structuring capacity in bus services PPPs with business models that improve sector competition and formalization.In the roads project in Bahia, the WB is contributing to the improvement of the State’s transport and logistics efficiency and safety, while enhancing the Borrower’s capacity in environmental and disaster risk management. In Tocantins, for instance, the WB is fostering effectiveness of road transport and enhanced efficiency of selected public services in support of the Borrower's integrating development to social agenda in gender by addressing gender-based violence in the project areas.In the State of São Paulo, the WB is enhancing road resilience, while improving rural accessibility. These three projects improve and rehabilitate roads used to transport commodities and agriculture products for export from rural areas; strengthen road safety; provide connectivity to indigenous communities and rural areas (throughout all-seasons), and bring a proactive gender agenda, whereby the projects amplify results by promoting gender empowerment and preparing communities to repel issues surrounding sexual exploitation and prostitution of minors.

        Located 500 kilometers off the west coast of Africa, Cabo Verde is an archipelago of 10 islands. The country has an estimated population of 520,500 spread across nine islands that are scattered within a large water area, which constitutes a major constraint to growth and development. Only 10% of its territory is classified as arable land, and the country possesses limited mineral resources. Cabo Verde's economy is driven by tourism grounded in year-round attractive weather, beautiful beaches, stable democracy, limited security risks and proximity to Europe. Its limited economies of scale create significant connectivity issues, as well as challenges for service delivery including energy, water, education, and health.  Despite the challenges associated with being a small island economy, Cabo Verde witnessed spectacular social and economic progress between 1990 and 2008, driven mainly by the rapid development of inclusive tourist resorts Political Context Politics in Cabo Verde have been largely consensus-oriented, and since its independence from Portugal in 1975, Cabo Verde has not experienced a single coup d’état. Elections are considered free and fair, and parties in power alternate regularly. The current Government of Cabo Verde has been in office since the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2016, which led to a change with the victory of the opposition Movimento para Democracia (MpD) after 15 years of government under the Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde (PAICV). These two parties dominate Cabo Verde’s political scene and are both fairly centrist. The next legislative and presidential elections are scheduled for the first half of 2021. Economic Overview During the period of 2009-2015, economic growth decelerated significantly, a result of the protracted impact of the global financial crisis. Countercyclical fiscal measures did not restore growth and instead led to a sharp increase in the stock of public debt. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovery started in 2016 and reached 5.5% in 2019 (4.2 in per capita terms), well above the potential growth rate of 3.6%. On the demand side, growth was driven by high consumption (public and private) and strong export performance. On the supply side, construction, retail, transport, and tourism services contributed to the dynamism of the economy. Tourism and travel-related industries represent 25% of GDP and drive around 40% of overall economic performance. The primary fiscal balance stood at 0.7% of GDP in 2019, turning positive for the first time in a decade. The overall fiscal deficit declined from 2.8% of GDP in 2018 to 1.9% in 2019. Improved fiscal performance is due to central government consolidation efforts combined with the reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  However, the risk of external debt distress remains high.  The unfolding COVID-19 crisis will reduce economic growth, delay fiscal consolidation, halt public debt decline, and slow poverty reduction in Cabo Verde. GDP growth is expected to have the largest contraction on record in 2020, The country relies heavily on tourism that is the hardest hit sector. Tourism receipts alone are expected to decline by 70% compared to 2019. The crisis opened a large fiscal financing gap in 2020, which has been filled mainly by concessional borrowing and grants from Development Partners. The World Bank has responded to this crisis with three operations: the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project; the Cabo Verde Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Financing with CAT-DDO; and the Second State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Reform and Fiscal Management Development Policy Financing (DPF) that is under preparation.

        World Bank Group Engagement in Cabo Verde The work conducted by the World Bank Group in Cabo Verde is determined by a partnership framework designed to respond to the country’s challenges.  The World Bank's portfolio grew strongly from $ 82.5 million in 2015 to $ 106 million in 2019. The sector focus of the portfolio is dominated by the transport sector with about 46% of funding but was fairly balanced with 19% of funding going to the human development in areas such as education and social protection. 19% went to the finance and competitiveness sector and 19% to the governance sector. The current portfolio of six projects is relatively young with an average age of 1.7 years. IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, had aggregated commitments of $5.8 million.

        Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$797 and a Human Development Index ranking of 169 out of 189 countries in 2019.  According to the Human Capital Index, a child born today in Haiti will grow up to be only 45% as productive as they could be if he/she had enjoyed full education and health. However, the country has been successful in containing the cholera outbreak, with zero laboratory-confirmed cases since January 2019.The latest official poverty estimate (2012) suggested that over 6 million Haitians lived below the poverty line of US$2.41 per day, and more than 2.5 million fell below the extreme poverty line of US$1.12 per day. The poverty gap between urban and rural areas has increased.Recurrent episodes of institutional and political instability have hindered Haiti’s economic and social development. GDP annual growth averaged only 1.3% over the past two decades. GDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.4% in 2019, and the country has experienced rapid currency depreciation (25.5%), and rampant inflation (17.3%) at the end of the fiscal year.The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already weak economy and political instability in Haiti. While the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Haiti remains relatively low compared to other countries in the region, the number of cases has been rising, and the country is still very vulnerable. COVID-19 is expected to lead to significant economic losses and could set back poverty reduction efforts. The pandemic is expected to disproportionately affect the poor and most vulnerable populations, including women, reinforcing existing social inequalities. Economic growth is expected to decline to GDP by 3.1 % in 2020 as the service sector contracts, supply chains are disrupted, and remittances fall as the global economy heads into recession. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to over 6% of GDP (from a pre-COVID-19 forecast of 3%) and inflation is expected to reach over 20%. The pace and shape of economic recovery will depend on the progression of the pandemic and its ramifications throughout the global economy, and progress toward resolution of the lingering political crisis.In addition to the challenges posed by the pandemic, Haiti remains highly vulnerable to natural hazards, mainly hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. More than 96% of the population is exposed to these natural hazards. Hurricane Matthew, which hit the country in 2016, caused losses and damages estimated at 32% of 2015 GDP. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity, and impacts of extreme weather events in the country.

        The World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Haiti was discussed by the Board of Directors in September 2015 and updated in 2018 through the Performance and Learning Review. It is designed to support the country’s efforts to provide economic opportunities for all its people and to combat poverty.Remaining within the broad parameters of the Haiti CPF, the WBG program was adjusted in 2020 to support the Government of Haiti’s response to COVID-19 crises. These adjustments align with the four pillars of the WBG COVID-19 Crisis Response Approach Paper “Saving Lives, Scaling-up Impact and Getting Back on Track,” which include: 1) saving lives; 2) protecting poor and vulnerable people; 3) ensuring sustainable business growth and job creation; and 4) strengthening policies, institutions, and investments for rebuilding better.Since April 2020, the Bank has approved several operations and restructured ongoing projects to support the health sector response to save lives, financed social protection measures and cash transfers to protect the poor and vulnerable, as well as initiatives to support food security and livelihoods. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) also provided emergency support to the private sector, for example in the garment sector for production of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 response. In the recovery phase, engagement will focus on strengthening policies, institutions and investments for rebuilding better, with investment operations supporting SMEs and private sector jobs, resilient infrastructure, and digital connectivity.WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAMThe World Bank's portfolio in Haiti has 20 active projects, with a total commitment amount of over US$834.41 million as of October 2020. This is complemented by US$129 million from trust funds that support the implementation of these projects.The International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries, allocated US$260 million for Haiti for the period 2020-2022.Haiti has received a fast-tracked US$20 million grant to help address the health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Another US$20 million grant was approved as budget support financing aimed at increasing Haiti’s capacity to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and enhance resilience to natural hazards and health-related shocks.In addition to this new financing, support has been provided to other critical sectors during the pandemic by reprogramming existing resources, including by activating Contingent Emergency Response Components (CERCs). One CERC has allowed funds to be reallocated under an agriculture project to support food security by safeguarding production for upcoming cropping cycles. A second CERC financed emergency cash transfers through the Municipal Development and Urban Resilience Project to ease some of the economic and social challenges for the most vulnerable.Work has been done under an ongoing education project to ensure continuity of the school feeding project, despite school closures, and find new methods of remote learning. The ongoing water and sanitation project has ramped up hand washing and hygiene awareness, particularly in high-risk areas like the border crossing, health centers, and marketplaces. More information about the multisectoral response to the COVID-19 crisis is available here. Going forward, the World Bank is also looking at additional initiatives to support the country’s efforts for economic recovery, resilience, and protecting the vulnerable.Overall, the urban, resilience and land sector represents the largest segment of the World Bank portfolio in Haiti, with over 24% of the total financing, followed by the transport sector with 23%, and the energy and extractives sector at 12%. Other key areas include the agriculture and food sector, with 11% of total financing, the health, nutrition and population sector with 9%, and the education and water sectors, each with 8%. Remaining resources are earmarked for the finance, governance, macroeconomics, trade and investment, and social protection and jobs sectors.In addition to IDA activities, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) supports the private sector in Haiti. As of October 1, 2020, IFC’s portfolio comprised 11 projects with an initial commitment of $154m, of which US$29 million has been mobilized from other partners. IFC supports private sector projects in Haiti in the areas of energy, beverages, garment manufacturing, financial markets, and hospitality.While supporting the private sector in mitigating the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic and paving the way for a strong recovery, the IFC program aims to increase financial inclusion, create jobs, and facilitate access to sustainable basic infrastructures by making catalytic investments. It also contributes to the development of a competitive and inclusive economy through technical assistance and advisory programs designed to make the business environment more attractive for investors and for micro, small, and medium enterprises.

        During recent years, Honduras had registered the second highest economic growth rates in Central America, only behind Panama. The country’s GDP growth reached 4.8 percent in 2017, 3.7 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019, above the average in Central America and well above the average in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).Honduras possesses multiple strengths with the potential for a faster growth and higher shared prosperity, with its strategic location, a growing industrial base, ongoing efforts to diversify its exports, and a young and growing population.However, the country has been facing high levels of poverty and inequality. A 48.3 percent of people live in poverty in the country (2018, with updated official poverty lines) and the percentage of people living in poverty in rural areas (60.1 percent) is higher than those living in poverty in urban areas (38.4 percent). Inequality (GINI 52.1 in 2018, among the highest in the region and the world) has also resulted in one of the smallest middle classes in LAC (11 percent in 2015, compared with 35 percent regional average).In addition, Honduras struggles with high levels of violence, with over 38 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (2018). Moreover, Honduras is vastly exposed to adverse natural events and climate change, especially heavy rainfall and drought that occur regularly and disproportionately affect the poor.The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly impacting Honduras’s economy. The country’s GDP is expected to contract by 7.1 percent in 2020 due to a sharper than expected fall in trade, investment and consumption amid the global slowdown and prolonged containment measures. A deeper than expected GDP contraction and high unemployment in the United States –the key trade and investment partner for Honduras and the largest source of remittances– amplified this contraction. The employment and income losses are expected to impact the poor, the near poor and the middle class.To minimize the impact on economic activity and social welfare, the Government adopted strict containment measures, authorizing new borrowing for US$2.5 billion (10 percent of the GDP), and prioritized healthcare and humanitarian services, including basic needs support to the poor, as well as support to firms. A prudent macroeconomic framework helped contain vulnerabilities, buoyed by the IMF program.The country’s economy is expected to rebound in 2021 to a 4.9 percent growth, amid the reactivation of domestic economic activity and recovering investment and external demand; but risks and challenges remain. A deeper global downturn amid the prolonged pandemic could weaken economic recovery and continue to threaten the health and welfare of the population.Continued focus on boosting competitiveness in rural economic development, investing in human capital and strengthening social protection in Honduras can also improve social outcomes and support recovery by fostering more job and economic opportunities among the country’s most vulnerable. Institutional reforms on key issues, such as improving the sustainability of the electricity sector, as well as governance and the business climate, can also contribute to further developing a framework for inclusive growth in Honduras.

        Since COVID-19 struck, the World Bank has been working intensely on fast, broad actions to limit harm and help countries, including Honduras, prepare for recovery and rebuilding better and stronger than before, by focusing on four priorities:    i) saving lives threatened by the pandemic;    ii) protecting the poor and vulnerable;    iii) securing the foundations of the economy to shorten the time to recovery; and    iv) strengthening policies and institutions for resilience based on transparent and sustainable debt and investments.The World Bank’s current portfolio in Honduras totals US$542.95 million in commitments and includes eleven investment projects. World Bank initiatives support sectors in Honduras such as rural competitiveness, social protection, education, water and food security and disaster risk management.World Bank-financed operations approved during 2020 include a US$ 20 million emergency investment project to respond to the threat posed by COVID-19; a US$ 119 million credit to allow the country to mobilize financial resources to respond to the emergency caused by COVID-19; US$ 30 million to support an investment project to improve the quality of pre-school education services, and a US$ 45 million project to improve water supply services in participating urban municipalities in Honduras.

        Through the Education Quality, Good Governance and Institutional Strengthening Project, the Secretary of Education managed to expand school coverage in disadvantaged communities from 36 percent to 50 percent through the opening and equipping of nearly 800 pre-schools, as well as training for all their volunteer teachers.With support from the Nutrition and Social Protection Project, the Government of Honduras helped 36,000 at-risk children avoid food insecurity and improved their social security through a pilot education program benefitting vulnerable youth. The Social Protection Project focused on increasing school attendance and use of preventive health services by vulnerable families through conditional cash transfers known as Bono Vida Mejor. The project benefitted more than 1.5 million Hondurans (about 300,000 families) living in extreme poverty.The Project to Modernize the Water and Sanitation Sector supported the decentralization of water and sanitation services in eight municipalities, with populations between 40,000 and 300,000, by establishing autonomous municipal water and sanitation service providers that collect revenue and provide increased coverage. Infrastructure works financed by the Project directly benefited 13,167 families with improved water services and 3,786 families with improved sanitation. Overall, the improvements in the utilities indirectly benefitted about 650,000 people (108,000 families).The Rural Competitiveness Project (COMRURAL) has contributed to increase productivity, competitiveness, and market linkages among 7,200 small-scale rural producers of coffee, dairy, honey and other products in Honduras. Each US$1 invested by COMRURAL as part of a productive alliance has leveraged US$1.5 from private financial institutions (around US$12.5 million in total), increasing the financial inclusion and creditworthiness of small-scale farmers. Since 2008, the Project has contributed in making agricultural value chains more competitive and increasing the volume of gross sales of rural producers by 23 percent. Producers supported by COMRURAL produce around 30 percent of all the specialty coffee exported by Honduras to the United States, Europe and Asia.Implemented from 2006 to 2016, the Rural Infrastructure Project improved access, quality and sustainability of basic infrastructure services, including the construction of 113 water and sanitation projects and the installation of 4,893 latrines, benefitting 20,751 families in 112 communities. Additionally, the project financed 8,550 rural electrification projects (of which 98% where solar photovoltaic energy systems) and help habilitate 844 kilometers of power lines in 282 communities, benefitting approximately 84,220 people. The project also contributed to the rehabilitation of 666.93 kilometers of rural roads and provided adequate maintenance mechanisms for 593 kilometers of roads.The Disaster Risk Management Project is strengthening capacities for comprehensive management of disaster risks at the municipal and national government levels. It also helps to improve their capacity for rapid and effective emergency response. The project supports the implementation of disaster risk management programs in 81 of the country’s most vulnerable municipalities, benefitting approximately five million people.The World Bank has provided technical assistance and grants to support several initiatives in Honduras to strengthen transparency, good governance and improved multi-sector interactions in key development areas, such as the Open Government Partnership (OGP), the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Transparency Initiative for Construction and Public Infrastructure (CoST).

        The Peruvian economy has experienced two distinct phases of economic development since the turn of the century. Between 2002 and 2013, Peru was one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America, with an average GDP growth rate of 6.1 percent annually. Prudent macroeconomic policies and broad-reaching structural reforms in a favorable external environment created a scenario of high growth and low inflation.The strong growth in employment and income sharply reduced poverty rates. The poverty rate (the percentage of the population living on USD 5.5 a day) fell from 52.2 percent in 2005 to 26.1 percent in 2013. This is equivalent to 6.4 million people escaping poverty during that period. Extreme poverty (the population living on USD 3.2 a day) declined from 30.9 percent to 11.4 percent in the same period.Between 2014 and 2019, GDP growth slowed to an annual average rate of 3.1 percent, mainly owing to lower international commodity prices, including copper, the leading Peruvian export commodity. This led to a temporary reduction in private investment, less fiscal income and a slowdown in consumption. Two factors attenuated the impact of this external shock on GDP, enabling continued growth, albeit at a slower pace. The first was the prudent management of fiscal, monetary and exchange policies, especially during the boom. This enabled the country to endure the decline in fiscal income without drastically adjusting spending and to have international reserves for an ordered adjustment of the exchange rate. Second was the surge in mining production as projects implemented during the previous years matured, which increased exports and offset the deceleration in domestic demand.In this context, the current account deficit diminished, from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.5 percent in 2019. This external deficit has been financed mainly with long-term capital inflows. Net international reserves remained stable, reaching 30 percent of GDP by March 2020.As part of the adjustment, the fiscal deficit has temporarily increased, reaching a peak of 3.0 percent of GDP in 2017. The higher deficit stems from a decline in revenues resulting from lower commodity prices and the economic slowdown, and an increase in recurrent expenditures in recent years, especially for goods, services and wages.  Fiscal revenues rebounded in the two subsequent years, reducing the fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2019.Peru has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A strict generalized quarantine led to a GDP decline of 17.4% in the first half of 2020. According to the World Bank High Frequency Surveys, Peruvian households experienced one of the largest employment and income losses in LAC. Employment losses and risk aversion will affect consumption during the rest of the year, while uncertainty will continue to hamper the recovery of private investment. The government has developed a comprehensive economic relief and aid program to protect the vulnerable population and support companies, including cash- transfers, tax payments deferrals and credit guarantees for the private sector. However, the slowdown in economic activity will lead to a substantial increase in monetary poverty, which is projected to reach pre-2012 levels. Given the depth of recession in 2020, a strong rebound is expected in 2021, assuming accelerated execution of public investment and improved global conditions with the roll out of a COVID-19 vaccine.Looking ahead, the economy is expected to stabilize at rates near those observed during the pre-crisis period. The challenge for the Peruvian economy is to accelerate GDP growth, promote shared prosperity and provide protection to its citizens against negative shocks of generalized and individual nature. To achieve this, it will be necessary to support state effectiveness to deliver public services and generate protection schemes, as well as to provide better connective infrastructure and formulate policies to reduce rigidities in factor and products markets.

        The 2017-2021 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) of the World Bank Group (WBG) responds to the Government of Peru's agenda and to the priorities identified in the Systematic Country Diagnostic.The CPF focuses on eight key objectives structured in three pillars: (i) productivity for growth; (ii) citizen services throughout the country; and (iii) management of natural resources and climate risk. This framework reflects the commitment of the WBG to provide Peru with comprehensive solutions, combining global knowledge and timely financing based on the country’s need to strengthen its institutions and increase efficiency in the use of public resources.The World Bank portfolio includes 17 investment projects totaling USD 1 billion. A robust program of Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) has been an important tool for providing personalized consultancy and knowledge services. Since 2013, the Government of Peru has signed more than 40 RAS agreements for a total of USD 4 million, eight of which were signed during the current period.The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has a current portfolio of USD 191 million, which provides funding to 11 institutions in Peru. The IFC's portfolio includes investments in financial institutions (USD 92 million), infrastructure (USD 53 million), logistics (USD 38 million), petroleum, gas and mining (USD 6 million), and telecommunications (USD 2 million). The IFC has also mobilized USD 118 million in additional resources.The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has increased its guarantees in Peru in recent years. MIGA's current program totals USD 253 million and focuses on support infrastructure (Jorge Chavez International Airport) and the financial sector (covering Banco Santander Peru's mandatory reserves). Recently, a project for USD 247 million was added to the current CPF. In the future, MIGA will expand its support for the country's private-sector development efforts in accordance with CPF objectives.

        Detailed performance results may be found at  Peru - Performance and learning review of the country partnership strategy for the period FY12-FY16.Increase access to and quality of social services for the poorSignificant advances have been made in this pillar, particularly in areas associated with safety nets, education and basic health, as well as justice administration services. Coverage of safety net programs, such as the conditional cash transfer program Juntos, increased from 700 to 900 districts and now includes the poorest districts in the country, reaching 284, 357 additional beneficiaries from the baseline of 474,064. In education, the World Bank supported the implementation of an evaluation system based on students’ learning, teaching internships and school leadership in basic education (kindergarten through Grade 11). Access to justice administration services has also improved through the establishment of legal aid centers in densely populated peri-urban districts, which is reflected in the increase in the number of consultations, from 100,000 in 2011 to 149,000 in 2014.Connecting the poor to services and markets The coverage and quality of water and sanitation services have improved in both urban and rural areas, as evidenced by the increase in daily hours of water service, from 16 in 2011 to 19.2 in 2013 in Lima, as well as by the decrease in the incidence of blocked sewer lines.The Decentralized Rural Transport Program rehabilitated 3,277 kilometers of rural roads, which has reduced travel time to schools by 24.2 percent which triggered 19.2% increase in school enrolment rates among children aged 12 to 18.  The government incorporated a rural electrification model implemented in a Bank-financed project for the continued development of the sector. This model uses distribution firms to develop, build and co-finance rural electrification sub-projects. The Rural Electrification project provided conventional grid connections and renewable energy systems to over 105,000 new connections, servicing an estimated 450,000 persons.Finally, thanks to a US$300 million loan approved in September 2015, the Lima Metro Line 2 Project will drastically reduce travel times in Lima by providing a new transport system that will alleviate city traffic and pollution.Sustainable growth and productivityThe World Bank has been working to increase assets and improve economic conditions of rural families. The first phase of the Development of the Rural Highlands Project supported approximately 35,000 families (nearly 10% of rural families) to increase the net value of their domestic production by 42% in selected areas of Apurímac, Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junín, Huánuco and Pasco.Initiatives such as the Project to Strengthen the Sustainable Management of the Guano Islands, Isles and Capes National Reserve System as well as the Dedicated Mechanism for Indigenous People and Saweto Local Communities, which have received grants from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Strategic Climate Fund, respectively, support agricultural innovation, biodiversity and the sustainable management of ecosystems.Inclusive governance and performance of the public administrationSupport from the WBG has focused on strengthening fiscal management and public investments at the national and local levels. Initial results have been encouraging. The WBG has also been working with the Ministry of the Economy and Finance to define a strategy for analyzing the sub-national investment cycle and making recommendations to reduce obstacles and transnational costs, with a view to improving the efficiency of public investments.The World Bank, through the Boosting Human Capital and Productivity Development Policy Financing with a Deferred Drawdown Option project, for US$1.25 billion, supports the Government of Peru in its efforts to strengthen the quality of public education and improve the business environment for enterprises by reducing market entrance, operation and exit costs. It also supports government measures to create a simplified customs system that facilitates exports and access to international markets, among other actions.The Public Expenditure and Fiscal Risk Management with a Deferred Drawdown Option project, for US$1.25 billion, supports government efforts to improve public expenditure management in sub-national governments in order to promote fiscal responsibility and improve their administration, efficiency and transparency.

        StrategyNumber of Active Projects14IBRD LendingUS$943 milionEU Trust Funds3 (€7.9 million)The World Bank Group’s engagement in Serbia is guided by the February 2019 Performance and Learning Review. This reaffirmed the overarching goal of the FY16–20 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) to support the creation of a competitive and inclusive economy in Serbia and through this, achieve the country’s integration into the EU.Key areas of WBG support in Serbia include: restoring fiscal and macroeconomic stabilitycreating conditions for accelerated private sector growth and job creationimproving infrastructurestrengthening public sector management and improving public service delivery to citizensas a cross-cutting theme, responding to climate change and disaster risksA Systematic Country Diagnostic Update, completed in April 2020, underscored environmental sustainability and governance as critical to Serbia’s shared prosperity, challenges that have been highlighted by the impact of the pandemic.The active portfolio reflects these priorities through 14 projects in real estate management, the business environment, competitiveness and jobs, innovative entrepreneurship, health, agriculture, transport, disaster risk management, financial sector reform, public sector modernization (including the digitalization of selected public services and the modernization of tax administration), and early childhood education, as well as one regional project aimed at facilitating trade and transport in the Western Balkans. Key Engagement The WBG has engaged in a multi-faceted effort to address Serbia’s complex legacy reforms, including commercial reform of state-owned enterprises, financial consolidation in public utilities and public transport companies, and more efficient core public administration.Completion of the missing segments of the Corridor X highway on both the E-75 and E-80 sections improves regional connectivity, helping to unleash Serbia’s economic potential.More than four years of intensive dialogue and technical advice, combined with policy-based and results-based lending, have started to yield important and increasingly impressive results in several sectors. Key operations have included the Public Enterprise and Public Utilities Development Policy Lending (DPL) series, the Competitiveness and Jobs Project, the Program for Results in support of Public Administration Modernization and Optimization, the State-Owned Financial Institutions Reform Project, and the Program for Results in support of Enhancing Infrastructure Efficiency and Sustainability. In FY20, three new operations were added: the Accelerating Innovation and Growth Entrepreneurship Project, the Competitive Agriculture Project, and the Emergency COVID-19 Response Project to tackle the outbreak of the virus.As a result of these efforts, public utilities, for example,  are returning to financial health with gradually improving services, and local scientists are linking to enterprises to commercialize their innovations, thus contributing to growth and jobs. Next generation reforms are focusing on a new growth agenda and deepening public sector reforms to promote economic initiative, entrepreneurship, innovation, a digital economy, and a post-COVID-19 green recovery in order to lay the foundations for Serbia’s alignment with the EU Green Deal and progress toward EU accession.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsGrowth in 2020 will decline by an estimated 3 percent after a robust 4.2 percent expansion in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in state consumption, following a large fiscal stimulus program that included wage subsidies and tax breaks. The contribution of net exports to growth remains negative, as exports decline more than imports. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) will decline to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2020 from 6.3 percent in 2019. An increase in agriculture output of 2.2 percent in 2020 will partly offset declines in industrial activity and the services sector. The fiscal deficit of 7.6 percent of GDP this year is expected to narrow to 2.1 percent in 2021 and to 0.5 percent in 2022. Poverty (living on income under US$5.5/day in 2011 purchasing power parity terms, the standardized middle-income-country poverty line) is expected to slightly increase to 18.9 percent this year from 18.2 percent in 2019. Public debt will increase to 59.6 percent of GDP in 2020 following a drop to 52.9 percent in 2019. Inflation remains low and stable, allowing the National Bank of Serbia to lower its policy rate to 1.25 percent in June 2020. External imbalances have narrowed, and FDI inflows are expected to be sufficient to cover the current account deficit. Economic OutlookThe COVID-19 outbreak and related containment measures are taking a heavy toll on the Serbian economy and leading to much lower growth than previously expected.  The economy entered a recession in 2020, amid declining tourism and transport activity, lower remittances, decelerating exports, and lower FDI and investment overall. To mitigate the pandemic’s negative economic impact, the Serbian authorities approved a comprehensive relief package in late March.  Over the medium term (2021–23), growth will return to its previous trajectory. This medium-term outlook crucially depends on international developments (including the impact of COVID-19), the pace of structural reforms, and political developments.  Aside from the direct impact on health outcomes, the anticipated decline in services, lower investments, depressed demand for Serbian exports, and mobility restrictions will hurt jobs and labor income. Poor and vulnerable households may be disproportionately affected.  Risks are associated primarily with the length and depth of the crisis caused by the pandemic and the implementation of containment measures. In the medium term, regional disputes and slow progress on the EU accession process could affect investment sentiment and delay investment projects.

        A sustained period of political and institutional progress reflects a country transitioning out of fragility and protracted crisis. The 2011 Provisional Constitution, the 2012 establishment of the federal government, and the subsequent formation of four new Federal Member States are re-drawing Somalia’s new federal map and creating the space for a political settlement. Although key constitutional questions remain open, federalism offers a new means to negotiate power and resources, and to manage developmental imbalances between the more stable northern regions and those in the south still emerging from conflict. Somalia’s private sector remains a source of resilience and innovation and political relations in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea regions are experiencing dynamic change, with potential new opportunities for Somalia to benefit from its proximity to the Ethiopian market for trade and regional integration.Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Decision Point Somalia reached the Decision Point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative on March 25, 2020, restoring the country’s access to regular concessional financing and launching the process toward debt relief. It cleared its arrears to the African Development Bank (AfDB), the International Monetary Fund and the International Development Association, and reduced its external debt to $3.9 billion (78% of the revised 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) from $5.3 billion. On March 31, 2020, Somalia reached agreement with the Paris Club on terms of debt relief, and it is working with remaining creditors to reach similar agreements. Somalia also resumed servicing its outstanding debt to the AfDB and IDA. To receive irrevocable debt relief, Somalia must maintain sound macroeconomic policies, implement its poverty reduction strategy—the Ninth National Development Plan (NDP9)—for at least one year, and complete a set of policy measures known as Completion Point triggers that are aimed at promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction.Economic Development Years of conflict and fragility have left Somalia’s economy with a range of challenges, including population growth outstripping economic growth, acute poverty and vulnerability, recurrent external trade and climate shocks. Weak fiscal space and institutions, active insurgency and an incomplete political settlement have also affected the country’s economic strength.Somalia also has several opportunities, as the economy is transitioning from traditional, rural pastoralism to urban, trade and services. Somalia’s economy has remained resilient and is realizing moderate growth despite recurrent shocks and crises, including drought and insecurity. Somalia’s growth in 2019 was estimated at 2.9%, following slow recovery from a prolonged drought in 2016/17. Somalia’s exposure to multiple types of shocks such as climate and water related changes, the locust infestation, conflict and insecurity and more recently, the COVID-19 global health pandemic, presents numerous challenges to a country at a nascent stage of state-building. The effects of COVID-19 are projected to have substantial headwinds on the economy, with growth downgraded from 3.2% before the onset of the health pandemic to potentially negative 2.5 to 3.0% , as consumption falls due to lower remittances and job losses, and exports of livestock decline. A shock of this magnitude is likely to result in structural changes in the economy, with potential job losses in the formal sector and informality further increasing.The government is also committed to institutional reforms and reengagement with the region, including opportunities to rebuild human capital and chart a pathway toward economic resilience and growth.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) continues to contribute to a well-coordinated international effort in Somalia, based on partnership between agencies that engage across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF FY2019-22) was endorsed in September 2018 and guides country engagement for an integrated WBG response. Joint Implementation Plans across the Bank, focusing particularly on the role of the private sector via the International Finance Corporation (IFC), will deliver comprehensively to the client. The CPF helps to identify common constraints limiting development opportunities to focus attention at regional and global level. It also helps drive the data and analytical agenda for the WBG. WBG activities are clustered around two CPF priorities: (1) Strengthening Institutions to Deliver Services(2) Restoring Economic Resilience and OpportunitiesCOVID-19 and the locust invasion are expected to exact a heavy human and economic toll in Somalia, adding a public health emergency to a situation in which Somalis are already dealing with multiple climate-related crises (cyclical droughts and floods, desert locusts) as well as prolonged armed conflict. The World Bank Group’s support has focused on helping scale government health and livelihoods financing in the short and medium-term, accompanied by a proposed supplemental budgetary support operation. The current country portfolio is approximately $1.23 billion in 18 projects. Recently approved projects include:Somalia Crisis Recovery Project ($137.5 million) approved in May, 2020. The project supports the recovery of livelihoods and infrastructure in flood and drought-affected areas and strengthen capacity for disaster preparedness nationwide. The project also includes a $20.5 million emergency investment in COVID response for immediate prevention and containment measures.Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing Phase III ($68 million) approved in June 2020. The new phase evolves the RCRF program towards protecting basic services through performance-based fiscal transfers to Federal Member States.Somalia Re-engagement and Reform Supplemental Development Policy Financing ($55.0 million) approved in June, 2020. The goal objectives of the DPF are to facilitate full normalization of relations with the World Bank Group (WBG) and support Somalia’s economic recovery through policy reforms that strengthen fiscal management and promote inclusive private sector-led growth. The proposed supplemental financing aims to mitigate the effects of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis on the reform program supported by the DPF.Shock Responsive Safety Net for Locust Response Project ($40.0 million) approved in June, 2020. The project focuses on addressing the immediate impact of the locust infestation on poor and vulnerable households by meeting their short-term food security and consumption needs and protecting their livelihoods and human capital assets through emergency cash transfer.

        The World Bank program in Somalia is co-financed by International Development Association grants since March 2020 and builds on and scales-up a portfolio largely funded by the Multi-Partner Fund (MPF), and pre-arrears clearance grants that has supported wide ranging reforms. The current portfolio focuses on core state functions, socio-economic recovery and urban development in Somalia through 18 projects totaling $1.23 billion. Supporting ReformsImproving public financial accountability and institutional development: With the support of MPF-funded Capacity Injection Project (CIP) and the Somaliland Civil Service Reform Project, the government has assisted ministries and departments to develop management plans, strengthened Human Resource functions and payrolls, and financed the appointment of staff, including women, to line ministries and core government agencies to remedy gaps in institutional capacity. The federal government (FGS) continues to rebuild its core public financial management systems, notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is currently preparing regulations covering budget preparation and execution, payment processing, cash advances, and cash management and banking. The federal government continues to publish the annual budget, quarterly financial statements, and monthly execution reports. All five federal member states (FMS) now publish quarterly all-of-government revenue realization and budget execution. The Bank-supported Financial Governance Committee has overall oversight of financial governance and has to date reviewed 42 concessions contracts resulting in the amendment of 30. Increased domestic revenue mobilization and resource sharing: In collaboration with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank has supported initiation of a revenue mobilization strategy, a new Revenue Law clarifying FGS/FMS responsibilities, development of tax policy units and deployment of tax identification numbers. The inter-governmental fiscal framework and harmonization of taxes will require sustained engagement but the Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing Project (RCRF) is convening Ministers of Finance, reaching agreements and harmonizing the approach to fiscal transfers, through Development Policy Financing . The Public Expenditure Review due in FY21 includes domestic revenue mobilization, fiscal federalism, wage bill and public financial management assessment. Improving systems for inclusive social services in social protection, health, and education are ongoing through the Baxnaanu safety net program. This includes the development of a national social registry benefiting 200,000 households. Through RCRF, the FGS has undertaken proficiency testing of nearly 3,000 primary and secondary teachers and is preparing to provide case management and safe spaces for victims of gender-based violence. Enhanced Infrastructure: With support of the Somalia Urban Resilience Project (SURP) I and II, the FGS and FMS have begun road rehabilitation and generated employment in the transport sector in Mogadishu and Garowe, which has helped to build capacity of municipalities in urban resilience. SURP II is financing additional road construction in Kismayo and Baidoa, and scale investments in Mogadishu and Garowe, and plans to scale-up to other urban areas in Somalia.Creating business opportunities: With World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) support, Somalia has made gains on improving the business environment and lowering barriers to entry. With assistance from the SCORE project, Somalia has adopted laws and regulations to strengthen the business climate; launched a business registration system in Mogadishu; improved payment systems and approved new mobile money regulations. It also commenced implementation of the Communication Act with the adoption of regulations on interconnection, altogether with the establishment of the Communications Authority. Strengthening access to digital finance: IFC has commissioned a diagnostic which covers broad topics of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) banking, agribusiness finance and digital finance. The outcome of the study will provide input to the design of targeted solutions to enhance financial inclusion including digital finance]. The SCALED-UP project has successfully established the MSME Financing Facility (“Gargaara”), building on the earlier Multi-Partner Fund-financed SCORE, which mobilized $6.5 million in private financing and created more than 2,000 jobs job through its catalytic matching grant scheme. In addition, the FGS has adopted a Digital ID Policy and made progress toward issuing licenses to telecom operators.

        Yemen has been embroiled in conflict since early 2015. The poorest country in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) before the conflict escalated, now, according to the UN, it is suffering the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Fighting has devastated the economy, destroyed critical infrastructure, and led to food insecurity verging on famine. In 2020, the UN estimated 24.3 million people—80% of the population—were “at risk” of hunger and disease, of whom roughly 14.4 million were in acute need of assistance. Socio-economic conditions deteriorated further in 2020, affected by low global oil prices, the economic fallout of the COVID-19 crisis, and weak public infrastructure, as well as extreme climate events and natural disasters. Distortions created by the fragmentation of institutional capacity in the Central Bank of Yemen and other government agencies, and by diverging policy decisions taken by parties to the conflict, have further compounded the crisis. Conflict has interrupted services and caused acute shortages of basic inputs, including fuel, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the economy is likely to contract from a low base in the first half of 2020. The oil sector (the only large export earner) has been hit hard by low global oil prices, and non-oil activity has suffered from the slowdown in COVID-19-related trade and from exceptionall`y heavy rainfalls, which caused intense flooding, damage to infrastructure, and human casualties.An estimated 20.5 million people are without safe water and sanitation, and 19.9 million without adequate healthcare. As a result, Yemen has been grappling with mass outbreaks of preventable diseases, such as cholera, diphtheria, measles, and Dengue Fever. Waves of currency depreciations in 2018 and 2019 have created inflationary pressure that has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Disruptions to public infrastructure and financial services have severely affected private sector activity. More than 40% of Yemeni households are estimated to have lost their primary source of income and, consequently, find it difficult to buy even the minimum amount of food. Poverty is worsening: Whereas before the crisis, it affected almost half the country’s population of about 29 million, now it affects an estimated three-quarters of it—71% to 78% of Yemenis. Women are more severely affected than men.Economic and social prospects, both in 2020 and beyond, are uncertain, hinging on the political and security situation. Most recently, the compounded threats of continued conflict, the spread of COVID-19, extensive flooding, and locusts have pushed the country close to catastrophe. The unaffordability of food is a threat to household welfare, as global food price increases and the depreciation of the Yemeni rial interact with COVID-19-related restrictions by food exporters. The impact desert locusts have had on crops has increased Yemen’s import dependence. A cessation of violence and hope for political reconciliation and the reintegration of state institutions would improve the operating environment for the private sector, and facilitate the reconstruction of the economy and rebuilding of the country’s social fabric.

In 2020, the UN estimated 24.3 million people—80% of the population—were “at risk” of hunger and disease, of whom roughly 14.4 million were in acute need of assistance. Socio-economic conditions deteriorated further in 2020, affected by low global oil prices, the economic fallout of the COVID-19 crisis, and weak public infrastructure, as well as extreme climate events and natural disasters. Distortions created by the fragmentation of institutional capacity in the Central Bank of Yemen and other government agencies, and by diverging policy decisions taken by parties to the conflict, have further compounded the crisis. Conflict has interrupted services and caused acute shortages of basic inputs, including fuel, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the economy is likely to contract from a low base in the first half of 2020. The oil sector (the only large export earner) has been hit hard by low global oil prices, and non-oil activity has suffered from the slowdown in COVID-19-related trade and from exceptionall`y heavy rainfalls, which caused intense flooding, damage to infrastructure, and human casualties.An estimated 20.5 million people are without safe water and sanitation, and 19.9 million without adequate healthcare. As a result, Yemen has been grappling with mass outbreaks of preventable diseases, such as cholera, diphtheria, measles, and Dengue Fever. Waves of currency depreciations in 2018 and 2019 have created inflationary pressure that has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Disruptions to public infrastructure and financial services have severely affected private sector activity. More than 40% of Yemeni households are estimated to have lost their primary source of income and, consequently, find it difficult to buy even the minimum amount of food. Poverty is worsening: Whereas before the crisis, it affected almost half the country’s population of about 29 million, now it affects an estimated three-quarters of it—71% to 78% of Yemenis. Women are more severely affected than men.Economic and social prospects, both in 2020 and beyond, are uncertain, hinging on the political and security situation. Most recently, the compounded threats of continued conflict, the spread of COVID-19, extensive flooding, and locusts have pushed the country close to catastrophe. The unaffordability of food is a threat to household welfare, as global food price increases and the depreciation of the Yemeni rial interact with COVID-19-related restrictions by food exporters. The impact desert locusts have had on crops has increased Yemen’s import dependence. A cessation of violence and hope for political reconciliation and the reintegration of state institutions would improve the operating environment for the private sector, and facilitate the reconstruction of the economy and rebuilding of the country’s social fabric.

        The World Bank Group’s Engagement Strategy for Yemen 2020–2021 remains focused on preserving basic services and the institutions that deliver them, as well as supporting people’s livelihoods and the country’s potential for economic recovery. Its priorities are institutional capacity, improving the resilience of service delivery, and providing support to conflict-affected poor and vulnerable Yemenis. The strategy also aims to encourage immediate economic growth by creating temporary jobs and supporting the private sector.The World Bank—through its concessional arm, IDA—has been providing large-scale emergency grants to Yemen during the conflict. Using an innovative partnership with the UN, IDA has financed $1.81 billion in emergency interventions, investing in people and the institutions they rely on for critical services. The IDA portfolio comprises six active projects: (1) the Emergency Crisis Response Project, US$848.58 million; (2) the Emergency Health and Nutrition Project, US$638 million; (3) the Emergency Integrated Urban Services Project, US$150 million; (4) the Emergency Electricity Access Project, US$50 million; and (5) The Yemen COVID-19 Response Project, US$26.9 million. An additional project, (6) Desert Locust Response Project, US$25 million; and 7) the US$36 million Smallholder Agricultural Production Restoration and Enhancement Project, are financed by the Global Agriculture Food Security Program (GAFSP) Trust Fund, administered by the World Bank.  Responding to Urgent NeedsThe COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique risk to Yemen, a country where less than 50% of health facilities are fully functional and even those that are lack enough specialists, equipment, and medicine to be truly effective. There are no doctors in 18% of the country’s 333 districts, most health personnel have not received their salaries for at least two years, and immunization coverage has dropped by 30% since the conflict began. IDA’s US$26.9 million Emergency Response Project is designed to strengthen Yemen’s fragile health systems for public health preparedness, including the detection, containment, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. About $23.4 million will finance the procurement of medical supplies, equipment, training and implementation expenses, as well as the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing health facilities. Initially, the project will specifically target large communities with high risks of local transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) is implementing the project through local health authorities.

        IDA grants have provided financing for critical service delivery, as well as for preserving human capital and the capacity of national institutions. IDA assistance has targeted the poorest and most vulnerable Yemeni households and communities nationwide, helping them cope with the impacts of the crisis through income support, cash transfers, health and nutrition interventions, cholera response, and restoring agricultural production. Supporting livelihood opportunities in partnership with UNDP and local institutions, namely the Social Fund for Development and the Public Works Project, the World Bank’s US$400 million IDA grant under the Emergency Crisis Response Project supports a cash-for-work and community-based investment program. The project has reached over 400,000 direct beneficiaries with wage employment; 4.97 million people have received access to community services (such as water, irrigation, and better roads); and 10.05 million workdays have been created. Over 341,542 mothers and children have received nutrition services. Nine microfinance institutions were supported and over 4,800 microfinance clients supported.  Responding to the risk of famine, the US$448.58 million emergency cash transfer component of the ECRP, implemented by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), has thus far completed eight rounds of emergency cash transfer payments to poor and vulnerable households across all of Yemen’s 333 districts. The last payment cycle, completed on July 29, 2020, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, reached approximately 1.42 million households (9 million individuals). The Emergency Cash Transfer program is financed partially through the Bank’s Crisis Response Window, with co-financing from the UK Department for International Development through the Yemen Emergency Multi Donor Trust Fund. Post-distribution monitoring found that 91% of beneficiaries used cash transfers to purchase food. Women comprise about 45% of the direct recipients. To provide essential health and nutrition services, the Emergency Health and Nutrition Project (EHNP), in partnership with UNICEF and WHO, has assisted 22 million people in all governorates across the country. Over 2 million people have gained access to improved water sources and 1.97 million to improved sanitation, and over 4 million people in districts at high risk of cholera have received oral cholera vaccine. More than 4 million women and children have received nutrition services, and 7.3 million children have been immunized. As many as 31,000 health personnel have been trained and over 4,200 health facilities supported with equipment and medical/non-medical supplies. About 230 health facilities that were not functioning before 2017 are now functional with EHNP support. The World Bank is also supporting activities to mitigate the risks from and respond to COVID-19 in Yemen through the Yemen COVID-19 Response Project (a US$26.9 million grant to WHO) since April 2020. This project helps the implementation of the National Preparedness and Response Plan developed by Yemeni health authorities, WHO and other partners.Restoring services in urban areas, the World Bank has partnered with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and local institutions in conflict-affected cities, acting through the Integrated Urban Services Emergency Project to provide more than 3 million beneficiaries with access to critical services. Up to now, the project has provided 2.4 million Yemenis with restored access to critical urban services, including water and sanitation, transport, energy, and solid waste management. And to increase people’s access to electricity in a sustainable way, the Yemen Emergency Electricity Access Project is partnering with local microfinance institutions (MFIs) to help them set up financing windows for high quality, small-scale, solar power solutions for households, and providing partial grants to make the systems more affordable. The project is also contracting solar suppliers and installers to provide grant-financed solar power systems to key facilities, including clinics, schools, and water wells in rural and peri-urban areas. As of September 2020, 6 MFIs were participating in the program and a total of 157,000 beneficiaries had gained household access to electricity. Electricity had been installed in 171 facilities (74 health facilities, 87 schools, and 10 water wells), restoring critical services to over 1.2 million beneficiaries. All electricity solutions supported under the project are fully renewable.

        StrategyNumber of Active Projects13 (2 IDA/IBRD blend projects are dual quantified)Lending$582.12 MillionIBRD$505.16 MillionIDA4 CreditsFor over 28 years, the World Bank Group (WBG) has been a key partner for Armenia, with a sustained history of successful investments in various sectors of the country’s economy and an equally deep history of policy reform dialogue.The new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY19–23 will support the rebalancing of Armenia’s economy toward a new growth model focused on boosting exports, enhancing human capital, and sustainably managing natural resources and the environment.The CPF is well aligned with the four thematic pillars outlined in the WBG’s Approach Paper that are defined as saving lives, protecting the poor and vulnerable, ensuring sustainable business growth, and strengthening policies, institutions, and investments.The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) have a rich and diversified portfolio in Armenia, with finance mobilized from a range of concessional sources using various instruments.The WBG is increasingly focused on sharing country knowledge and operational experience to leverage other development partners’ resources for effective public investment.KEY ENGAGEMENTThe World Bank has supported health reforms in Armenia since the late 1990s, investing in high-impact interventions to improve the quality of care, optimize the health facility network, and introduce financing mechanisms to boost service access and efficiency.Through the Health Financing and Primary Health Care Development Project (1997–2004) and the Health System Modernization Project (2004–16), the World Bank has supported the establishment of the State Health Agency to facilitate the strategic purchasing of health services, the introduction of a family medicine specialty at the primary health care level, and reductions in the oversized Marz bed capacity by 40 percent.The ongoing Disease Prevention and Control Project (2013–22) has financed performance-based financing to increase the detection of chronic diseases, including 1.4 million screens for hypertension. The project has supported the construction and renovation of five regional hospitals, as well as procurement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including 70 ventilators, 80 patient monitors, and other equipment for case management and personal protection.To inform new investments in this regard, the World Bank team is providing technical assistance toward the goal of universal health coverage. This support aims to inform an increase in public financing for health care, provide recommendations on aligning allocative decisions with better service delivery, identify interventions to improve the quality of service delivery, and help convene policy and technical knowledge exchanges on global experience in investing in universal health coverage.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsArmenia’s economic contraction of 5.7 percent in the first half of 2020 was driven by a 9 and 31 percent sharp contraction of private consumption and investment, respectively, which was only partially offset by higher government spending and import compression.Among the sectors, construction and services were most affected, with the financial and information and communications technology sectors remaining more resilient due to their greater reliance on digital technologies. Agricultural output grew by 1.8 percent y-o-y in the first half of 2020, and a low base in 2019 pushed growth in mining to 21.7 percent y-o-y.In the first seven months of 2020, current budget spending increased by 19 percent y-o-y, while capital spending was up by 62 percent from a low base in 2019. Revenues fell by 6 percent y-o-y, resulting in a deficit of around 1.7 percent of projected annual GDP in the first half of the year.The smaller trade deficit, due to a larger contraction in imports than exports, partly offset the decline in services (particularly tourism) and income accounts (remittances). Despite slowing inflows of foreign direct investment, support from international financial institutions financed the deficit and kept reserves at around US$2.7 billion at the end of August.The Armenian dram, after depreciating by 5.5 percent in March following the initial COVID-19-related shock, recovered in April and has remained largely stable since. The financial sector entered the pandemic with strong capital and liquidity levels. As a result, banks have been able to offer moratoria on debt servicing to borrowers while continuing to extend credit. Credits and deposits expanded by 17 and 11 percent y-o-y, respectively, as of end-July. Economic Outlook The economy is projected to contract by 6.3 percent in 2020 before rebounding by 4.6 percent in 2021. Output is projected to recover to pre-COVID levels only in 2022. However, the risks are firmly on the downside, particularly from a potential pickup in COVID-19 infections in the upcoming winter and from the lack of or delay in the availability of vaccines in 2021. In this downside growth scenario, the economy will contract further in 2020 with a slower rebound in 2021, which will postpone the recovery of output to pre-COVID levels to 2023.Inflation will remain muted and converge on the Central Bank of Armenia’s 4 percent target gradually over the medium term.The rise in the budget deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP, coupled with the decline in GDP, is expected to push public debt up by 10 percentage points to 63 percent of GDP in 2020. The Government’s 2021–2023 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework envisages a strong fiscal consolidation that brings the deficit below 2 percent of GDP by 2023. This corresponds to a gradual decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, consistent with the fiscal rule.The economic contraction in 2020 is expected to cause a sharp increase in unemployment.

        Cameroon was declared IBRD creditworthy in 2014 and is currently a blend country: its IDA18 allocation is about $787 million and current IBRD exposure limit, $392 million.The World Bank’s portfolio comprises 18 national IDA, Global Environment Facility, and Trust Fund operations, with a net commitment of roughly $2.4 billion.The IBRD is financing a transport sector development project and an electricity transmission and energy reform project.The World Bank is also supporting the improvement of Cameroon’s competitiveness in energy, transport, and telecommunications as well as working to improve the business climate. The Bank is also helping improve service delivery for human development through  a social safety net system  and local development, with a focus on providing greater access to basic public services  through infrastructure upgrades and capacity building in the northern regions.The World Bank has adopted a new Country Partnership Framework with Cameroon for the period 2017-2021, aligned with the Government’s 2010-2013 National Growth and Employment Strategy. This new framework includes 12 objectives grouped into three areas:eliminate multiple poverty traps in rural areas, in particular in the northern regions;strengthen infrastructure and private sector development; andimprove governance.On July 8, 2019, the World Bank approved the report on the mid-term review of the Country Partnership Framework with Cameroon. The report affirmed the relevance of the pillars that are the focus of the World Bank’s involvement but recommends a stronger emphasis on the fragility-related factors that impede the country’s development efforts.

        Boosting Electricity ProductionThe World Bank is helping Cameroon’s Government boost access to electricity by financing (through IBRD and IDA) two projects under way in this sector: the Lom Pangar Hydropower Project will unlock up to 6,000 MW in hydropotential on the Sanaga River, and the Upstream Nachtigal Hydroelectric Project will support construction of a 420-MW dam. The Nachtigal power plant will be connected to the Southern Interconnected Grid, which represents approximately 94% of national electricity consumption in Cameroon.Enhancing Regional Trade and IntegrationThe CEMAC Transport and Transit Facilitation Project is an IDA project totaling $680 million, of which $409 million has been earmarked for Cameroon, and focuses on the Douala-N’Djamena and Douala-Bangui transit corridors. The project has reduced the average transit time imports undergo from exiting the port of Douala to arriving in N’Djamena in Chad, and their dwell times at the port of Douala.Improving Agricultural CompetitivenessCurrent World Bank engagement in the agricultural sector consists of two IDA-financed lending operations: the Agriculture Investment and Market Development Project ($100 million in IDA funds and $25 million in IFC funds), which seeks to transform the low-productivity, subsistence-oriented cassava, maize, and sorghum subsectors into commercially oriented and competitive value chains in four agro-ecological zones; and the Livestock Development Project ($100 million from IDA) that aims to improve productivity, market access, and the livelihoods of small livestock farmers in target agro-ecological zones, including pastoralists in the Far North.Developing Rural Areas and Improving Social ServicesThe multi-donor, IDA-funded Community Development Program Support Project is an important instrument used in the implementation of the Government’s rural development strategy. The project assists the Government of Cameroon in setting up and implementing a decentralized financing mechanism to introduce participatory community development in rural areas and improve access to basic social services. The program has generated strong local support from the communities involved, helping to improve school infrastructure, provide 270,000 people with access to potable water, and increase access by 20,000 households to roads and basic social services.Better Access and Quality of Health ServicesThe Health Sector Support Investment Project targets district-level activities, providing financial resources and a performance-based incentive system to boost outcomes in health facilities across 26 districts covering a total population of 2.5 million. Management tools (used within the Performance Based Financing, PBF) framework engendered behavioral change among health staff, and thereby assisted facilities to improve their governance and the efficiency of their use of the financial resources generated through service delivery.An impact evaluation of the PBF pilot was completed in 2016, showing significant improvements in the utilization and quality of essential health services (the percentage of fully vaccinated children increased from 47% to 88% in PBF facility catchment areas).Improving the Quality and Efficiency of the Education SystemThe Education Development Capacity Building and Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) grant for education supported activities to improve the equity and quality of learning in the sector.The Equity and Quality for Improved Learning Project is supporting a transition, moving from teachers financed by parents in public schools to government contract teachers, providing training to existing and contract teachers, and providing learning materials.

Two of its border regions with Nigeria (northwest and southwest) are Anglophone, while the rest of the country is Francophone. Cameroon is endowed with rich natural resources, including oil and gas, minerals, high-value species of timber, and agricultural products, such as coffee, cotton, cocoa, maize, and cassava.Political ContextCameroon’s ruling party, the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM), has long dominated the country’s political landscape, occupying 148 of 180 seats in the National Assembly and 81 of 100 in the Senate. In November 2018, disputed election results returned President Paul Biya to office.

Figures from the UN Refugee Agency (HCR) show that Cameroon is currently hosting over 401,213 refugees, primarily from the Central African Republic (289,982) and Nigeria (108,164). Social ContextBecause its poverty reduction rate is lagging behind its population growth rate, the overall number of poor in Cameroon increased by 12% to 8.1 million between 2007 and 2014, and poverty is increasingly concentrated, with 56% of poor living in the northern regions.Economic OverviewCameroon is the largest economy in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), a region experiencing an economic crisis triggered by the steep fall in oil prices. Along with its CEMAC partners, Cameroon has therefore had to put fiscal adjustment measures in place to adjust to the terms of trade shock and restore macro-stability and confidence in the common currency.Growth in Cameroon is expected to reach 4.3% this year. The rebound is driven by three factors: an increase in natural gas production, with a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) offshore terminal coming online; the slight downturn in the oil sector; and sustained momentum in the construction, industry, housing, and services sectors.The World Bank’s Country Economic Memorandum, issued in April 2017, notes that if Cameroon is to become an upper-middle-income country by 2035, it will have to increase productivity and unleash the potential of its private sector.Specifically, Cameroon’s real GDP will have to grow by roughly 8% (or 5.7% per capita) between 2015 to 2035, which in turn will require the investment share of GDP to increase from about 20% in 2015 to 30% in 2035, and productivity growth to reach 2% over the same period from its average zero growth rate over the past decade. These challenges, though daunting, can be met. The public expenditure review published by the World Bank in February 2018 proposes five ways to achieve these goals.Development ChallengesCameroon suffers from weak governance, hindering its development and ability to attract investment. It ranks 152 out of 180 countries in the 2018 Transparency International corruption perceptions index, and 166 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2019  report.

        Cameroon is one of the least aid-dependent countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. International partners such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union (EU), the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), the Banque de Développement des États de l’Afrique Centrale (BDEAC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations, and Germany have strengthened their coordination mechanisms in order to further the Paris Declaration and Busan agendas for Cameroon.

        President Ivan Duque Marquez began his presidential term on August 7th, 2018, and it will end on August 7, 2022. Duque, from the Democratic Center party, won the elections by achieving 53.95% of the votes (10,351,304 votes) while his rival Gustavo Petro reached 41.83% (8,024,697 votes). The main pillars of its government are legality, entrepreneurship, and equity, with transversal axes in terms of infrastructure, environmental sustainability and innovation.Colombia has received a massive and accelerating inflow of migrants from Venezuela. Approximately 1.8 million Venezuelans have arrived in Colombia as of December 2020, according to Colombian official statistics. Colombia has taken a leading role in adopting an open borders policy and implementing good practices in the provision of services to Venezuelan migrants and returned Colombians in areas such as education to health, services of employment and humanitarian aid.Colombia has a track record of prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management, anchored on an inflation targeting regime, a flexible exchange rate, and a rule-based fiscal framework, which allowed the economy to grow uninterrupted since 2000. Also, Colombia halved poverty over the past ten years.However, productivity growth is low and it has actually been a drag on economic growth. A large infrastructure gap, low labor productivity, low trade integration and barriers to domestic competition are among the factors that weigh on total factor productivity. Exports are highly concentrated in non-renewable commodities (oil in particular), which increases the exposure of the economy to price shocks. Finally, Colombia is one of the countries with the highest income inequality and labor market informality in Latin America.After slowing down to 1.4 percent in 2017, economic growth accelerated to 3.3 percent in 2019, driven by robust private consumption and stronger investment. Growth was on track to accelerate further in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy hard, causing a very deep recession.The Government responded promptly to the crisis and took decisive actions to protect lives and livelihood, and to support the economy. On the fiscal front, the Government announced a sizable fiscal package for 2020 totaling over COP 31 trillion (or almost 3 percent of 2019 GDP), to provide additional resources for the health system, increase transfers for vulnerable groups through the expansion of existing programs and the establishment of new ones (Ingreso solidario, an unconditional cash transfer program, and VAT reimbursements for low-income segments of the population), delay tax collection in selected sectors, lower tariffs for strategic health imports, and help hard-hit firms pay employees. In addition, the government also set up special lines of credit and loan guarantees for firms in selected sectors or that have been deeply affected by the crisis, potentially totaling 72 trillion (or 6.8 percent of 2019 GDP). To ensure adequate fiscal support, the suspension clause of the fiscal rule was activated for 2020 and 2021. On the monetary front, the central bank cut its intervention rate 250 basis points between March and September and reduced it to its lowest historical level.  In addition, it introduced a broad range of measures to increase liquidity.These measures are expected to mitigate the impact on the economy of COVID-19 and of the public health measures taken to contain its spread. Yet, the economy is projected to contract 7.2 percent in 2020. A rebound in growth is expected for 2021-2022, provided that the pandemic is short-lived. The low interest rate environment, facilitated by the central bank, is expected to boost private consumption growth to the extent that COVID-19 containment measures are eased. It is also expected to facilitate a gradual rebound in investment as major infrastructure projects such as the 4G road and the Bogota metro projects resume at full speed. Inflation is expected to fall towards the lower part of the central bank’s targeted range, as exchange rate pass through pressures are tempered by weak demand.The lower oil prices and reductions in global demand are expected to compensate the demand-driven drop in imports, while strong inflows of remittances and lower dividends to foreign direct investors are expected to cause the current account deficit to improve slightly, from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2019 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2020. A normalization of trade flows and an unfolding of backlogs of dividend payments to foreign direct investors is expected to cause the current account deficit rebound in 2021, until it stabilizes at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2022.Beyond the medium-term, the outlook depends on the duration and severity of the crisis, the way and speed at which the fiscal deficit will be reduced, and the country’s ability to address existing structural bottlenecks.

Finally, Colombia is one of the countries with the highest income inequality and labor market informality in Latin America.After slowing down to 1.4 percent in 2017, economic growth accelerated to 3.3 percent in 2019, driven by robust private consumption and stronger investment. Growth was on track to accelerate further in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy hard, causing a very deep recession.The Government responded promptly to the crisis and took decisive actions to protect lives and livelihood, and to support the economy. On the fiscal front, the Government announced a sizable fiscal package for 2020 totaling over COP 31 trillion (or almost 3 percent of 2019 GDP), to provide additional resources for the health system, increase transfers for vulnerable groups through the expansion of existing programs and the establishment of new ones (Ingreso solidario, an unconditional cash transfer program, and VAT reimbursements for low-income segments of the population), delay tax collection in selected sectors, lower tariffs for strategic health imports, and help hard-hit firms pay employees. In addition, the government also set up special lines of credit and loan guarantees for firms in selected sectors or that have been deeply affected by the crisis, potentially totaling 72 trillion (or 6.8 percent of 2019 GDP). To ensure adequate fiscal support, the suspension clause of the fiscal rule was activated for 2020 and 2021. On the monetary front, the central bank cut its intervention rate 250 basis points between March and September and reduced it to its lowest historical level.  In addition, it introduced a broad range of measures to increase liquidity.These measures are expected to mitigate the impact on the economy of COVID-19 and of the public health measures taken to contain its spread. Yet, the economy is projected to contract 7.2 percent in 2020. A rebound in growth is expected for 2021-2022, provided that the pandemic is short-lived. The low interest rate environment, facilitated by the central bank, is expected to boost private consumption growth to the extent that COVID-19 containment measures are eased. It is also expected to facilitate a gradual rebound in investment as major infrastructure projects such as the 4G road and the Bogota metro projects resume at full speed. Inflation is expected to fall towards the lower part of the central bank’s targeted range, as exchange rate pass through pressures are tempered by weak demand.The lower oil prices and reductions in global demand are expected to compensate the demand-driven drop in imports, while strong inflows of remittances and lower dividends to foreign direct investors are expected to cause the current account deficit to improve slightly, from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2019 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2020. A normalization of trade flows and an unfolding of backlogs of dividend payments to foreign direct investors is expected to cause the current account deficit rebound in 2021, until it stabilizes at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2022.Beyond the medium-term, the outlook depends on the duration and severity of the crisis, the way and speed at which the fiscal deficit will be reduced, and the country’s ability to address existing structural bottlenecks.

In May 2018, President Condé announced a cabinet reshuffle and appointed Kassory Fofana prime minister. Presidential elections are scheduled for 2020.Economic OverviewGrowth stood at around 10% in 2016 and 2017, before slowing to 5.8% in 2018. Growth nevertheless remains robust, driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mining sector. The mining industry grew at an annual rate of roughly 50% in 2016 and 2017, while the non-mining sector posted a 5.4% growth rate in 2018, with investment in infrastructure and the expansion of the primary and tertiary sectors remaining strong.Inflation, which stood at 9.8% in 2018, approached double-digit levels, owing to an increase in fuel prices and electricity rates.The fiscal balance improved from -2.1% of GDP in 2017 to -1.1% in 2018, owing to reduced subsidies on fuel prices, higher electricity rates, and constraints on hiring and promotions in the public sector.Despite these measures, tax revenue fell by 0.8% of GDP to 12.5% in 2018. An extraordinary transfer of 0.4% of GDP from the Post and Telecommunications Regulatory Agency helped improve the fiscal balance.With respect to expenditure, investments fell by 0.8% of GDP despite an increase in capital expenditure of 0.7% of GDP financed by external resources. The budget deficit was essentially financed by external resources, which was due to the fall in domestic funding.The risk of debt distress remains moderate, even though non-concessional external borrowing increased in 2018. The total public debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 39.6% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2018.The Guinean economy continues to grapple with two main risks in 2019: the country must sustain macroeconomic and fiscal reforms and ensure social and political stability.

        At the donor conference held with the Guinean Government and Guinea’s development partners in November 2017, a total commitment of $21 billion was made by the country’s partners and the private sector. These funds will support implementation of the new national economic and social development plan. The World Bank pledged $1.6 billion and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $750 million.The World Bank’s engagement in Guinea is determined by a new six-year Country Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY2018-23. This CPF for Guinea focuses on three pillars:Fiscal and Natural Resource Management;Human Development;Agricultural Productivity and Economic Growth.The current World Bank portfolio in Guinea stands at $897.17 million (credits, grants, and trust funds) covering 15 national operations ($538.97 million), 9 regional operations ($358.20 million), and 4 trust funds.In 2018, the Government of Guinea and the World Bank signed six financing agreements covering such projects as the Guinea-Mali Interconnection project. This project aims to increase the energy supply to Eastern Guinea, enable electricity trade between the two countries, and boost Guinea’s electricity export capability for power exports to the other West African Power Pool countries.The other projects that were approved during this fiscal year cover the following areas and sectors: strengthening of macroeconomic stability and institutional capacity; promotion of the West Africa Unique Identification for Regional Integration and Inclusion program; reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health; agriculture; and energy.In 2019, the Guinean Government and the World Bank signed two financing agreements covering such projects as the Guinea Project for Results in Early Childhood and Basic Education and the Support to MSME Growth, Competitiveness, and Access to Finance Project. The first project is designed to improve access to and the quality of basic education. The second project is set to increase investment in fragile countries by helping create new markets. It is also contributing to the Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) initiative.

        The West African nation of Guinea is bordered to the north by Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Mali, and to the south by Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d’Ivoire. In 2017, the country had a population of 12.7 million.Political ContextPresident Alpha Condé was re-elected to a second term in office with 57% of the vote in October 2015. In May 2018, President Condé announced a cabinet reshuffle and appointed Kassory Fofana prime minister. Presidential elections are scheduled for 2020.Economic OverviewGrowth stood at around 10% in 2016 and 2017, before slowing to 5.8% in 2018. Growth nevertheless remains robust, driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mining sector. The mining industry grew at an annual rate of roughly 50% in 2016 and 2017, while the non-mining sector posted a 5.4% growth rate in 2018, with investment in infrastructure and the expansion of the primary and tertiary sectors remaining strong.Inflation, which stood at 9.8% in 2018, approached double-digit levels, owing to an increase in fuel prices and electricity rates.The fiscal balance improved from -2.1% of GDP in 2017 to -1.1% in 2018, owing to reduced subsidies on fuel prices, higher electricity rates, and constraints on hiring and promotions in the public sector.Despite these measures, tax revenue fell by 0.8% of GDP to 12.5% in 2018. An extraordinary transfer of 0.4% of GDP from the Post and Telecommunications Regulatory Agency helped improve the fiscal balance.With respect to expenditure, investments fell by 0.8% of GDP despite an increase in capital expenditure of 0.7% of GDP financed by external resources. The budget deficit was essentially financed by external resources, which was due to the fall in domestic funding.The risk of debt distress remains moderate, even though non-concessional external borrowing increased in 2018. The total public debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 39.6% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2018.The Guinean economy continues to grapple with two main risks in 2019: the country must sustain macroeconomic and fiscal reforms and ensure social and political stability. The slow pace of infrastructure development could decelerate growth. On the external front, lower commodity prices and a global economic slowdown could undermine growth in Guinea.Development ChallengesAgriculture and natural resources, as well as the manufacturing and services sectors, are some of Guinea’s economic assets. Agriculture is the country’s main source of employment and is critical for poverty reduction and rural development, providing income for 57% of rural households and employment for 52% of the workforce.While natural conditions are favorable for growth, Guinea must improve its governance if it hopes to fully realize this potential and step up the structural transformation process. Guinea is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change, with an overall rise in average temperatures and a decline in annual rainfall, particularly in the northwestern and northeastern regions.Guinea is endowed with vast natural resources, especially mining and hydropower resources, which could generate substantial income. Experience shows, however, that mining and hydropower can have serious negative effects, both direct and indirect, on biodiversity and the environment. These potential risks will require careful management.Another major challenge facing Guinea are the gender gaps in the areas of education and agricultural productivity, and with regard to employment and decision-making opportunities. Taken together, these factors diminish women’s prospects and undermine the country's growth trajectory. Other major constraints include weak human capital (with low literacy rates), a poor health system, a lack of quality agricultural inputs, weak sector and local government management capacity, limited access to finance, and high unemployment, especially among young people.

        In addition to the Bretton Woods institutions, Guinea’s main development partners are the African Development Bank, the European Commission, the Islamic Development Bank, and Agence française de développement.The United Nations coordinates interventions in security reform, with contributions from bilateral aid as well as from ECOWAS and the African Union.USAID plays a crucial role in helping establish democratic institutions, complementing the European Union, which has led on support for the justice sector.Non-traditional development partners, including Arab countries, China, Brazil, Russia, and India, have focused on areas closely linked to Guinea’s comparative advantages in mining and agriculture, or on sectors where public-private partnerships could rapidly transform into solely private concerns.

        Iran’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at US$440 billion for the Iranian calendar year 2019/20, for a population of about 82.8 million. Iran’s economy is characterized by its hydrocarbon, agricultural, and service sectors, as well as a noticeable state presence in the manufacturing and financial services. Iran ranks second in the world for natural gas reserves and fourth in proven crude oil reserves. While its economic base is relatively diversified for an oil exporting country, economic activity and government revenues still rely on oil revenues and have, therefore, been volatile. The Iranian authorities have adopted a comprehensive strategy of market-based reforms in their 20-year economic vision document and sixth, 5-year development plan for the 2016/17 to 2021/22. The plan is comprised of three pillars, namely: the development of a resilient economy, progress in science and technology, and the promotion of cultural excellence. On the economic front, the development plan forecasts annual economic growth of 8%. Among the main priorities of the government during the five-year period are the reform of state-owned enterprises, financial and banking sectors, and the allocation and management of oil revenues.Iran’s real GDP contracted by 6.8% in 2019/20; in addition, the oil sector shrank by 38.7%. Non-oil GDP grew by 1.1%, driven by agriculture and manufacturing as exchange rate depreciation made domestic production more competitive. Expenditure-side components of 2019/20 GDP declined. The decline in GDP continued in Q1/2020/21 as COVID-19 border closures and containment measures in March and April contributed to GDP contracting by 3.5% (year-on-year), a modest contraction compared to many other countries. In contrast to past recessions, services were much more impacted; a reflection of the huge impact COVID-19 has had on service sectors around the globe. Higher government consumption expenditure in Q1 partly offset the contraction of other sectors.The economic situation led to a deterioration in labor force participation and employment rates. Employment had increased by 1.8% to reach 24.3 million in 2019/20, before falling by 1.5 million (y-o-y) in Q1/2020/21 as COVID-19 led to a decline across all sectors. Labor force participation dropped by 0.4 percentage points in 2019/20 to 44.1% and, in Q1-2020/21, the labor force shrank by 1.3 million (y-o-y). Unemployment rates in 2019/20 and Q1/2020/21 fell to 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Recession and COVID-19 have made gender gaps in the labor market worse, with only 14% of (working age) women working in 2019/20, down 0.6 percentage points from the previous year.The fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio deteriorated in 2019/20 as oil revenues fell to 2.2% of GDP. Current expenditure grew faster, due to a higher wage bill and transfers. The government resorted to issuing bonds and selling assets to compensate for smaller oil revenues and a lower tax base. To meet its financing needs, bond issuance jumped to 6.9% of GDP, following amendments to the country’s budget law. In 2020/21, the government began to sell shares in State-Owned Enterprises via the stock market and issued additional bonds through auctions held by the Central Bank of Iran.The current account surplus declined as trade restrictions led to real net exports falling by 26.9%. Oil exports fell below 0.7mbpd in 2019, after the end of US sanction waivers for major importers of Iran’s oil in April. Import contractions were large (38.1%) due to the rationing of foreign exchange reserves and US secondary sanctions on banking transactions related to trade with Iran. The contraction of non-oil trade accelerated to 30% (y-o-y, nominal) in April to August 2020, due to COVID-19 and expansion of the list of goods subject to import prohibition.Inflationary pressures were high in 2019/20, resurging in the first five months of 2020/21 as the Iranian rial depreciated. Inflation increased by 10 percentage points to 41.2% in 2019/20, due to inflationary expectations and higher cost push factors, including higher trade costs and a sharp exchange rate depreciation of 45.7%. Inflation was led by the cost of food and household rent, disproportionately impacting low-income deciles. In tandem with the trend in the exchange rate, inflation jumped to 6.4% (month-on-month) in July 2020, a 21-month high.Poverty in Iran—measuring in the World Bank’s upper-middle-income threshold of US$5.5 per day (2011 PPP)—fell between 2009 and 2013 by 5 percentage points to about 8%, before increasing in 2017 to 10.9%. There are stark urban/rural differences, with much higher poverty headcount rates of about 27% in rural areas, compared to about 6% in urban areas. Inequality, measured by the Gini index in per capita expenditure, fell sharply between 2009 and 2013—from 42.0 points to 37.4 points—but increased to 40.8 points in 2017. High inflation, increased gasoline prices in 2019, economic slowdown, and the economic shock caused by COVID-19 have given rise to concerns about household welfare and poverty. In the short-term, the fall in labor market incomes alone may lead to a 7-percentage point increase in poverty.  There is an expectation of regional differences in rising poverty levels, as well as the likelihood that households self-employed in the service sector, will be being more severely affected. And though government cash transfers, which were instrumental to reducing poverty during the period 2009 to 2013 can partly help compensate for lost earnings, their mitigation impact is hindered by high inflation continuing to erode the real value of the benefits. The government’s fiscal constraints may limit its scope for a wider response to the economic crisis, but the better targeting of cash transfers can help reduce their fiscal cost. Fiscal pressures are projected to increase because of the higher issuance of bonds and the increasing cost of COVID-19 in 2020/21. Government revenues are projected to reach a trough in 2020/21, before improving amid a moderate recovery of the economy overall. Inflationary pressure is expected to remain high due to economic uncertainty and economic recovery pressures.

The plan is comprised of three pillars, namely: the development of a resilient economy, progress in science and technology, and the promotion of cultural excellence. On the economic front, the development plan forecasts annual economic growth of 8%. Among the main priorities of the government during the five-year period are the reform of state-owned enterprises, financial and banking sectors, and the allocation and management of oil revenues.Iran’s real GDP contracted by 6.8% in 2019/20; in addition, the oil sector shrank by 38.7%. Non-oil GDP grew by 1.1%, driven by agriculture and manufacturing as exchange rate depreciation made domestic production more competitive. Expenditure-side components of 2019/20 GDP declined. The decline in GDP continued in Q1/2020/21 as COVID-19 border closures and containment measures in March and April contributed to GDP contracting by 3.5% (year-on-year), a modest contraction compared to many other countries. In contrast to past recessions, services were much more impacted; a reflection of the huge impact COVID-19 has had on service sectors around the globe. Higher government consumption expenditure in Q1 partly offset the contraction of other sectors.The economic situation led to a deterioration in labor force participation and employment rates. Employment had increased by 1.8% to reach 24.3 million in 2019/20, before falling by 1.5 million (y-o-y) in Q1/2020/21 as COVID-19 led to a decline across all sectors. Labor force participation dropped by 0.4 percentage points in 2019/20 to 44.1% and, in Q1-2020/21, the labor force shrank by 1.3 million (y-o-y). Unemployment rates in 2019/20 and Q1/2020/21 fell to 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Recession and COVID-19 have made gender gaps in the labor market worse, with only 14% of (working age) women working in 2019/20, down 0.6 percentage points from the previous year.The fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio deteriorated in 2019/20 as oil revenues fell to 2.2% of GDP. Current expenditure grew faster, due to a higher wage bill and transfers. The government resorted to issuing bonds and selling assets to compensate for smaller oil revenues and a lower tax base. To meet its financing needs, bond issuance jumped to 6.9% of GDP, following amendments to the country’s budget law. In 2020/21, the government began to sell shares in State-Owned Enterprises via the stock market and issued additional bonds through auctions held by the Central Bank of Iran.The current account surplus declined as trade restrictions led to real net exports falling by 26.9%. Oil exports fell below 0.7mbpd in 2019, after the end of US sanction waivers for major importers of Iran’s oil in April. Import contractions were large (38.1%) due to the rationing of foreign exchange reserves and US secondary sanctions on banking transactions related to trade with Iran. The contraction of non-oil trade accelerated to 30% (y-o-y, nominal) in April to August 2020, due to COVID-19 and expansion of the list of goods subject to import prohibition.Inflationary pressures were high in 2019/20, resurging in the first five months of 2020/21 as the Iranian rial depreciated. Inflation increased by 10 percentage points to 41.2% in 2019/20, due to inflationary expectations and higher cost push factors, including higher trade costs and a sharp exchange rate depreciation of 45.7%. Inflation was led by the cost of food and household rent, disproportionately impacting low-income deciles. In tandem with the trend in the exchange rate, inflation jumped to 6.4% (month-on-month) in July 2020, a 21-month high.Poverty in Iran—measuring in the World Bank’s upper-middle-income threshold of US$5.5 per day (2011 PPP)—fell between 2009 and 2013 by 5 percentage points to about 8%, before increasing in 2017 to 10.9%. There are stark urban/rural differences, with much higher poverty headcount rates of about 27% in rural areas, compared to about 6% in urban areas. Inequality, measured by the Gini index in per capita expenditure, fell sharply between 2009 and 2013—from 42.0 points to 37.4 points—but increased to 40.8 points in 2017. High inflation, increased gasoline prices in 2019, economic slowdown, and the economic shock caused by COVID-19 have given rise to concerns about household welfare and poverty. In the short-term, the fall in labor market incomes alone may lead to a 7-percentage point increase in poverty.  There is an expectation of regional differences in rising poverty levels, as well as the likelihood that households self-employed in the service sector, will be being more severely affected. And though government cash transfers, which were instrumental to reducing poverty during the period 2009 to 2013 can partly help compensate for lost earnings, their mitigation impact is hindered by high inflation continuing to erode the real value of the benefits. The government’s fiscal constraints may limit its scope for a wider response to the economic crisis, but the better targeting of cash transfers can help reduce their fiscal cost. Fiscal pressures are projected to increase because of the higher issuance of bonds and the increasing cost of COVID-19 in 2020/21. Government revenues are projected to reach a trough in 2020/21, before improving amid a moderate recovery of the economy overall. Inflationary pressure is expected to remain high due to economic uncertainty and economic recovery pressures.

        Iran’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at US$440 billion for the Iranian calendar year 2019/20, for a population of about 82.8 million. Iran’s economy is characterized by its hydrocarbon, agricultural, and service sectors, as well as a noticeable state presence in the manufacturing and financial services. Iran ranks second in the world for natural gas reserves and fourth in proven crude oil reserves.

        Until recently, the World Bank Group had no active lending program in Iran; the last IBRD project closed in 2012. However, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a major humanitarian crisis for the country, and with Iran the epicenter of COVID-19 infections in the region and  having contributed to the spread of the disease to neighboring countries and beyond), the World Bank approved a US$50 million Iran COVID-19 Emergency Response Project on May 26, 2020, on an exceptional basis.The project is part of the World Bank’s global approach to fighting the health crisis and promoting a public good. It will focus on the procurement of lifesaving, essential medical equipment for the country’s COVID-19 response. The World Health Organization (WHO) will implement the project, including the procurement of medical equipment. The World Bank will make direct payments to WHO with no funding channeled to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The World Bank has been producing an Iran Economic Monitor since April 2016, and carrying out analytical work on topics of interest to Iran and the international community. The first issue of the Iran Economic Monitor (Spring 2016) covered the oil and gas and financial sectors; the second issue (Fall 2016) included a special section on poverty and air pollution; the third issue (Spring 2017) covered pensions and water resource management; and the fourth issue (Fall 2017) included a special focus on labor markets and employment. The fifth issue (Fall 2018) examined Iran’s macroeconomic performance compared to that under previous sanctions, benchmarking key economic outcomes to those of its comparators, with a special section updating a 2014 to 2016 poverty analysis. The latest issue (Spring 2020) discusses recent economic developments and provides an initial assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic indicators and poverty under different scenarios.  The International Finance Corporation and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency which, along with the World Bank comprise the World Bank Group, have no programs in Iran at present.

        Kenya has made significant political, structural and economic reforms that have largely driven sustained economic growth, social development and political gains over the past decade. However, its key development challenges still include poverty, inequality, climate change, continued weak private sector investment and the vulnerability of the economy to internal and external shocks.Kenya ushered in a new political and economic governance system with the passage of a new constitution in 2010 that introduced a bicameral legislative house, devolved county government, a constitutionally tenured judiciary and electoral body. The first election under this new system was held in 2013. The August 8, 2017 presidential elections were nullified on September 1, 2017 by the Supreme Court, and a new presidential election was held on October 17, 2017. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second and final five-year term on November 28, 2017. In 2019, Kenya’s economic growth averaged 5.7%, placing Kenya as one of the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The recent economic expansion has been boosted by a stable macroeconomic environment, positive investor confidence and a resilient services sector. Kenya’s economy is being hit hard through supply and demand shocks on external and domestic fronts, interrupting its recent broad-based growth path. Apart from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the locust attack which started early 2020, has affected many parts of Kenya especially the North East. It has had a negative impact on the food security and growth of the agriculture sector in the country. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to decelerate from an annual average of 5.7% (2015-2019) to 1.5% in 2020. However, if takes longer than expected to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control, GDP could contract by 1.0% in 2020, and see a delay in the projected recovery to 5.2% growth in 2021. The downside risks include a protracted global recession undermining Kenya’s export, tourism and remittance inflows, further tightening of COVID-19 health response measures that disrupt the domestic economic activity, fiscal slippages and weather-related shocks. World Bank support to Kenya’s pandemic response includes emergency funding to strengthen medical services and reduce the spread of the virus, as well as budget support to help close the fiscal financing gap while supporting reforms that help advance the government’s inclusive growth agenda.  In addition to aligning the country’s long-term development agenda to Vision 2030,, the President outlined the “Big Four” development priority areas for his final term as President prioritizing manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing and food security.Social DevelopmentKenya met several of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets; reduced child mortality, near universal primary school enrollment, and narrowed gender gaps in education. Interventions and increased spending on health and education are paying dividends. While the healthcare system has faced challenges recently, devolved health care and free maternal health care at all public health facilities will improve health care outcomes and develop a more equitable health care system. Kenya has the potential to be one of Africa’s success stories from its growing youthful population, a dynamic private sector, highly skilled workforce, improved infrastructure, a new constitution, and its pivotal role in East Africa. Addressing the challenges of poverty, inequality, governance, the skills gap between market requirements and the education curriculum, climate change, low investment and low firm productivity to achieve rapid, sustained growth rates that will transform lives of ordinary citizens, will be a major goal for Kenya.

However, its key development challenges still include poverty, inequality, climate change, continued weak private sector investment and the vulnerability of the economy to internal and external shocks.Kenya ushered in a new political and economic governance system with the passage of a new constitution in 2010 that introduced a bicameral legislative house, devolved county government, a constitutionally tenured judiciary and electoral body. The first election under this new system was held in 2013. The August 8, 2017 presidential elections were nullified on September 1, 2017 by the Supreme Court, and a new presidential election was held on October 17, 2017. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second and final five-year term on November 28, 2017. In 2019, Kenya’s economic growth averaged 5.7%, placing Kenya as one of the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The recent economic expansion has been boosted by a stable macroeconomic environment, positive investor confidence and a resilient services sector. Kenya’s economy is being hit hard through supply and demand shocks on external and domestic fronts, interrupting its recent broad-based growth path. Apart from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the locust attack which started early 2020, has affected many parts of Kenya especially the North East. It has had a negative impact on the food security and growth of the agriculture sector in the country. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to decelerate from an annual average of 5.7% (2015-2019) to 1.5% in 2020. However, if takes longer than expected to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control, GDP could contract by 1.0% in 2020, and see a delay in the projected recovery to 5.2% growth in 2021. The downside risks include a protracted global recession undermining Kenya’s export, tourism and remittance inflows, further tightening of COVID-19 health response measures that disrupt the domestic economic activity, fiscal slippages and weather-related shocks. World Bank support to Kenya’s pandemic response includes emergency funding to strengthen medical services and reduce the spread of the virus, as well as budget support to help close the fiscal financing gap while supporting reforms that help advance the government’s inclusive growth agenda.  In addition to aligning the country’s long-term development agenda to Vision 2030,, the President outlined the “Big Four” development priority areas for his final term as President prioritizing manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing and food security.Social DevelopmentKenya met several of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets; reduced child mortality, near universal primary school enrollment, and narrowed gender gaps in education. Interventions and increased spending on health and education are paying dividends. While the healthcare system has faced challenges recently, devolved health care and free maternal health care at all public health facilities will improve health care outcomes and develop a more equitable health care system. Kenya has the potential to be one of Africa’s success stories from its growing youthful population, a dynamic private sector, highly skilled workforce, improved infrastructure, a new constitution, and its pivotal role in East Africa. Addressing the challenges of poverty, inequality, governance, the skills gap between market requirements and the education curriculum, climate change, low investment and low firm productivity to achieve rapid, sustained growth rates that will transform lives of ordinary citizens, will be a major goal for Kenya.

        The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2014-2018 for Kenya supports the government’s strategy of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Under the Performance and Learning Review FY20, which summarizes CPS implementation progress, was extended to FY20 and has been further extended further based on the ongoing efforts on COVID-19 (coronavirus) response. Discussions are underway for the preparation of a new Country Partnership Framework for Kenya for the period FY21-2026.  The current International Development Association portfolio stands at $7.53 billion in 39 projects: 30 national ($6.26 billion) and nine regional ($1.27 billion) projects. The Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment sector takes the largest of investments at 23% of the portfolio. Other development investments include infrastructure, social sectors, urban, agriculture, devolution, governance, justice, law and order, disaster risk management, forced displacements, private sector development, and statistical capacity building.Recently approved IDA projects include:The Kenya COVID 19 Learning Continuity in Basic Education Project ($10.8 million) approved July 13, 2020, which aims to enhance access to online and distance learning for all students in primary and secondary schools and facilitate a smooth transition in the return to school for targeted vulnerable students. The Emergency Locust Response Project ($43 million), approved on May 21, 2020, seeks to respond to the threat posed by the desert locust outbreak and to strengthen Kenya’s system for preparedness.The Kenya Second Inclusive Growth and Fiscal Management Development Policy Operation ($1000 million), approved on May 19, 2020  aims  to (i) crowd in private investment and financing for affordable housing; (ii) enhance farmer incomes and food security; (iii) create fiscal space (iv) crowd in private investment and leverage digitization, to support the government’s inclusive growth agenda.The COVID-19 Health Emergency Response Project ($50 million), approved on April 2, 2020 is supporting Kenya to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 (coronavirus) and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness.The Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development Project ($100 million), approved March 10, 2020 aims to improve management of priority fisheries and mariculture and increase access to complementary livelihood activities in coastal communities.The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) committed investment portfolio in Kenya stands at $884 million as of June 30, 2019. Most of IFC’s portfolio is attributable to the financial sector (67.3%) followed by manufacturing, agribusiness and services (20%) and infrastructure (12.7%). As the fourth largest country portfolio in Sub-Saharan Africa (10%), Kenya remains critical to IFC’s operations in the region. IFC remains committed to scaling up investment and advisory support especially in the current fiscal climate and within the context of the President Kenyatta’s Big Four focus areas – manufacturing, affordable housing, universal healthcare and food security. On the advisory side, total funds under management amount to approximately $45.6 million as of June 30th, 2019, supporting work across all four advisory business lines - access to finance, sustainable business, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and investment climate.The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency’s (MIGA) gross exposure in Kenya totaled $146 million as of July 2, 2020, comprising two projects to support foreign private investments in the energy sector and one project in the financial sector. The pipeline currently includes projects in renewable energy (off-grid solar and geothermal) and transport infrastructure (roads). MIGA is also engaged with the PPP Unit within the Ministry of Finance to work upstream on high-priority projects, particularly in the infrastructure space, as well as healthcare and affordable housing.

        More than 5.5 million people have befitted directly from the infrastructure and services supported under three urban sector programs; Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project, Kenya Informal Settlements Improvement Program, and Kenya Urban Support Program. Among other projects, these programs, which are spread across the country, have: Improved health conditions of 100,000 people through improved sanitation infrastructure and services: 186 kilometers of sewer lines have been laid, three treatment plants in Ruiru, Thika and Juja rehabilitated and 21 ablution blocks constructed, resulting to 8,500 sewer connections made across the three projectsReduced flooding through construction of storm water drainage, targeting flood prone zones: 300 kilometers of storm water drains have been constructed which have been crucial in tackling the flood menaceEnhanced security and livelihoods through provision of 400 high masts and 2000 streetlights in dense urban neighborhoods. Security has been enhanced for over 100,000 urban residents; urban street vendors have increased hours of operation improving incomes.Increased access to portable water to 8,000 households improving health status of communities: 120 kilometers of water pipelines have been constructed, with 11 elevated steel water tanks erected and in use, enhancing access to clean water to 20,000 people across the countryImproved mobility and accessibility through construction of 200 kilometers of all-season roads, with accompanying footpaths, cycle lanes, 150 kilometers of standalone non-motorized transport facilities, bridges and 10 commuter rail stations. The improved road and rail infrastructure, especially serving poor and dense neighborhoods, has enhanced accessibility, with 350,000 people benefitted directly from the commuter rail stations.The development of markets has improved trade: 7,000 traders are benefitting directly through the upgrading of 20 markets across the country. This has improved incomes and strengthened small and medium enterprise activities, with most businesses owned and operated by women. Increased access to portable water to 8,000 households improving health status of communities: 120 kilometers of water pipelines have been constructed, with 11 elevated steel water tanks erected and in use, enhancing access to clean water to 20,000 people across the country.Additional results include: The number of skilled birth deliveries in Kenya totals 1.15 million in 2019, an outcome to which the World Bank-supported Transforming Health Systems for Universal Care Project is contributing substantially.Time and cost of travel from Kitale to Lodwar have been reduced tremendously—from 11 to six hours—while the cost dropped from Ksh 3000 ($30) to Ksh 1500 ($15). Thanks to the improved state of the corridor including the completion of the Kainuk Bridge financed under the Eastern Africa Regional Transport, Trade, and Development Facilitation Project for Kenya.The Kenya Devolution Support Project (KDSP) has provided performance-based grants to incentivize county governments to improve systems and capacities that underpin enhanced service delivery. There has been improvement in overall institutional performance across county governments. With respect to public financial management, for example, there is improvement in the quality of financial statements and audit opinions. More importantly, two county governments, Makueni and Nyandarua received a clean audit opinion in the FY2017/18 audit results.Last Updated: Jul 31, 2020"

        Malawi ContextLocated in Southern Africa, Malawi is landlocked, sharing its borders with Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania. The country has an estimated population of 18.6 million (2019), which is is expected to double by 2038.Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world despite making significant economic and structural reforms to sustain economic growth. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, employing nearly 80% of the population, and it is vulnerable to external shocks, particularly climatic shocks.The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS), a series of five-year plans, guides the country’s development. The current MGDS III, Building a Productive, Competitive and Resilient Nation, will run through 2022 and focuses on education, energy, agriculture, health and tourism. The process is underway to develop a successor plan of Vision 2020, the country’s long-term development plan.Political ContextMalawi is a generally peaceful country and has had stable governments since independence in 1964. One-party rule ended in 1993; since then multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections have been held every five years.Malawi’s sixth tripartite elections were conducted in May 2019. The presidential results were nullified in February 2020 by the Constitutional Court. New presidential elections were held on June 23, 2020 where Lazarus Chakwera of the Malawi Congress Party and Saulos Chilima of the United Transformational Movement Party (known as the UTM Party) were elected as president and vice president respectively after getting 58.6% of the votes. They won against Peter Mutharika of Democratic Progressive Party and United Democratic Front coalition, who received 39.4% of the votes. President Lazarus Chakwera and Vice President Saulos Chilima lead a coalition of nine political parties.Economic OverviewMalawi’s three-year pathway of fast economic growth has been interrupted by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The full extent of the pandemic’s negative impact is still uncertain as the crisis unfolds but the widespread impact of the COVID-19 crisis is expected to be felt in the fourth quarter and beyond, with reductions in tax revenue paired with increased expenditure on health and economic policy responses.Malawi’s economy grew by 4.4% in 2019, a marked increase from 3.5% in 2018 supported by a rebound in agriculture production, as maize and key crops apart from tobacco increased. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2020 was projected in September 2019 at 4.8% due to an expectation of the second consecutive year of strong harvests, offset by continuing political uncertainty weighing on business activity and investment. Revenue and grants totaled 10.3% of GDP through December 2019, below the target of 12.2% of GDP. Total expenditure and net lending were below budgeted levels as the government spent 0.9% of GDP below the mid-year target of 14.0%, due to under-spending on development expenditure which was partially offset by recurrent expenditure overruns of 0.6 percent of GDP. Repeated high fiscal deficits have contributed to an accumulation of domestic debt such that the stock of domestic debt increased from 28.2 to 29.7% of GDP between 2018 and 2019.Social ContextMalawi has made progress in building its human capital—the knowledge, skills and health that people accumulate over their lives—in recent years. Life expectancy at birth is 63.7 years (2018 Population and Housing Census). The total fertility rate in 2015/16 was 4.4 children per woman down from 6.7 in 1992. Self-reported literacy (reading and writing in any language) is 71.6 for males and 65.9 for females (15+ years of age). However, poverty and inequality remain stubbornly high. The latest poverty figures show the national poverty rate increased slightly from 50.7% in 2010 to 51.5% in 2016, but extreme national poverty decreased from 24.5% in 2010/11 to 20.1 in 2016/17. Poverty is driven by low productivity in the agriculture sector, limited opportunities in non-farm activities, volatile economic growth, rapid population growth, and limited coverage of safety net programs and targeting challenges.Development ChallengesMalawi’s development challenges are multi-pronged, including vulnerability to external shocks such as weather and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has further negatively impacted economic growth. Other challenges include rapid population growth and environmental degradation. Energy shortages still stand out, with about 11.4% of the population having access to electricity. Infrastructure development, the manufacturing base, and adoption of new technology are low, and corruption levels remain high with Transparency International ranking Malawi at 123/180 economies in 2019.

        World Bank Engagement in MalawiThe new World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Malawi is under preparation. Consultations to inform the concept note preparation were initiated in FY19 and continued in FY20 with various stakeholders across the country including the government, parliamentarians, civil society organizations, academia, private sector and development partners. Informed by the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) analysis, the CPF will focus on addressing foundational issues of governance, citizen engagement and macroeconomic stability, economic diversification and job creating, and building human capital and resilience. The CPF is also guided by government priorities as outlined in the Third Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (2017-2022) and further incorporates lessons from the previous strategy.As of July 1, 2020, the World Bank’s portfolio consists of 15 International Development Association lending operations for a total of $1.62 billion in commitments and is complemented by $138.11 million in trust funds. The portfolio includes financing for national programs on agriculture, sustainable land management, basic service delivery (including health, education, and water and sanitation), as well as support in the energy, transportation, trade logistics, and financial sectors. COVID-19 ResponseThe government continues to undertake significant actions to address the health and economic impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) guided by the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. Other mitigation measures include the expansion of social protection, fiscal and monetary measures, as well as steps to support the financial sector and the expansion of mobile money services. The immediate health response has focused on detection, treatment and prevention. Social protection benefits were announced to expand to over 185,000 new urban households and frontloaded four months of the rural cash transfer program for existing beneficiaries.In April, World Bank approved $7 million in immediate funding to support Malawi’s response to the pandemic under a new Malawi COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project. In addition to the new operation, $30 million was made available from the Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Financing with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO) to strengthen the country’s response to the pandemic. The government fully recognizes that additional measures are needed while carefully considering the trade-off between social distancing policies to reduce the spread of the virus and losses to livelihood. Containment measures are intended to flatten the epidemic curve and to allow as many people as possible access health care options, while biding time to ramp up extensive testing. International Finance Corporation (IFC)IFC’s engagement in Malawi focuses on investment and advisory activities that help diversify the economy, develop the micro, small and medium enterprise sector, and improve access to finance.Under the infrastructure and natural resources program, IFC is providing public-private partnership advisory services to the water, transport, and energy sectors. IFC supports private sector involvement in hydro-electric power projects identified as a priority in Malawi’s Integrated Resource Plan. IFC is supporting value addition enterprises in the agribusiness sub-sector, diversification of Malawi’s exports, and is working with the government to help strengthen the warehouse receipts system.In the financial sector, IFC provides advisory support to Malawi’s financial institutions with the aim of increasing access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and to help improve the country’s collateral registry and credit reference systems.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) continues to contribute to Malawi’s development performance in various sectors including energy, health, agriculture, education, infrastructure development, private sector development and emergency response. Below are examples of results achieved in some World Bank-supported sectors.Linking farmers with markets through better roadsFarmers in 12 districts are benefiting from improved access to rural markets through the Second Agriculture Sector Wide Approach Support Programme (ASWAp-SP II). The World Bank-financed program is facilitating improvement of rural roads through labor intensive rehabilitation and upgrades, which provide  cost-effective solutions to relatively low-trafficked roads, easing the burden of access to markets for the local farmers. The roads are further linking agricultural productive areas to markets so farmers are reached with farm inputs and easily able to take their produce to markets. The upgrading of a total of 74km and rehabilitation of 1118km is expected to link up to 143 markets. More than 14,500 people have been employed on the ongoing works, of which 56% are women.Strengthening Safety Net Systems in Malawi Project- Fourth Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF IV)Now in its sixth year, the fourth Malawi Social Action Fund-Strengthening Safety Net Systems Project (MASAF IV) focused on strengthening Malawi’s social safety net delivery systems and coordination across social protection programs. By December 2019 MASAF IV supported the Malawi government to implement productive community driven public works (PPWP) that have built productive community assets and provided temporary employment for close to a million people, of which slightly over half were women, disbursing $57.4 million in wages. The project further supported the Malawi government to implement social cash transfers in 11 out of 28 rural districts in Malawi, supporting close to 127,000 extremely poor, most vulnerable and labor-constrained households—including elderly, disabled, and sick citizens—with social cash transfers amounting to $24 Million. The project has also supported the rolling out of Malawi’s social Unified Beneficiary Registry in 12 out of 28 districts, facilitating the capturing of at least half of household population in these districts. The successor to MASAF IV, the Social Support for Resilient Livelihoods Project (SSRLP) was declared effective June 1, 2020 and will continue supporting the government implementation of the government’s National Social Support Programme II.

        Mali, a vast Sahelian country, has a low-income economy that is undiversified and vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations. High population growth rates (a fertility rate of six children per woman in 2017) and climate change pose major risks for the country’s agriculture sector and food security.After rising to 47.2% between 2011 and 2015 owing to the security crisis, the extreme poverty rate fell slightly to 42.7% in 2019 as a result of exceptionally high agricultural production in the past four years. Poverty is concentrated in the rural areas of southern Mali (90%), where the population density is the highest.Political ContextMali has been experiencing instability and conflict since the military coup of 2012 and the occupation of the northern regions by armed groups. The operations of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) date back to July 2014.President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, first elected in 2013, was reelected to a second term in August 2018. Parliamentary elections scheduled for the fall of 2018 were postponed several times. The first round took place on March 29, 2020, following an electoral campaign marked by the kidnapping of Soumaïla Cissé, head of the Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) opposition party, in Saraféré on March 25, 2020. In the first round, 12 of 147 representatives were reelected. The remaining 125 seats will be awarded following the second round scheduled for April 19, 2020.Peace negotiations between the government and two rebel coalitions, the “Platform” and the “Coordination,” concluded with the signing of an agreement in June 2015. This agreement provides for greater decentralization, creating a special development zone for Mali’s northern regions. It includes several projects, among them the program of accelerated development in the north (Programme de développement accéléré du Nord) and the emergency program for the revival of development in the northern regions (Programme d’urgence pour la relance du développement des régions du Nord). However, the country is encountering difficulties with the implementation of this agreement.Security, which is critical for economic recovery and poverty reduction, remains fragile in the face of continued attacks by armed groups on UN peacekeepers, the Malian army, and civilians, mainly in the north and central regions.In July 2017, Germany, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, France, the European Union, and the United Nations Development Programme launched the Sahel Alliance in order to provide a coordinated and tailored response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since that time, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.Economic OverviewThe impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the Malian economy has, thus far, been limited. As a net oil importer, the country is benefiting from the sharp drop in the price of crude. Mali's main export item is gold, a traditional safe haven in times of crisis. Consequently, the crisis is expected to lead to an improvement in its terms of trade, which would facilitate a reduction of the current account deficit.These potential positive effects must, however, be viewed in perspective, especially since Mali faces the risk of a collapse in the prices of its agricultural exports and lower demand in the Euro zone. Furthermore, if the direct effects of the slowdown in China’s economic activity on Malian exports are moderate, Mali could experience importation difficulties in a situation where international value chains are disrupted.Using a baseline scenario in which China and the European Union experience a modest economic downturn and oil prices decline by 25%, Mali’s GDP growth is projected to fall to 4.9% in 2020, against 5.1% in 2019.In a more pessimistic scenario in which oil prices decline by 50%, the global economy experiences a very sharp downturn, and the virus spreads significantly among the Malian population, the impact on the Malian economy would be far greater. Social distancing measures and the lack of medical infrastructure to cope with the health crisis would disrupt domestic economic activity, leading to a roughly 4% decline in real GDP growth.Mali has the fiscal and monetary space to implement countercyclical policies. It could, however, have difficulty sustaining itself financially in a context of global uncertainty and risk aversion on the part of investors. In the short term, it would be to the government’s advantage to redirect expenditure toward public health services and take steps to increase its sources of revenue, including revenue from international technical and financial partners.Last Updated: Apr 22, 2020","

        The work conducted by the World Bank Group in Mali is determined by a partnership framework designed to respond to Mali’s challenges following the 2012 crisis. The International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Group’s institution that provides assistance to the poorest nations in the world, is currently financing 22 national projects and 8 regional projects in Mali totaling $1.5 billion (grants and loans included). These projects support the development of many areas such as:Energy;Reconstruction and economic recovery;Water and sanitation;The empowerment of women;The demographic dividend;Education.On April 10, 2020, the World Bank also approved $25.8 million in emergency financing from IDA— a 50% grant and 50% credit—to help Mali with its response to the coronavirus pandemic.International Finance Corporation (IFC)As of December 31, 2019, IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, had aggregated commitments of $33.8 million, including investments in the financial, infrastructure, and agro-industrial sectors. IFC's activities in Mali also include technical assistance projects that help boost financing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and improve the business climate, in collaboration with the World Bank.To further the development of the private sector, IFC is committed to:supporting the transformation of the agricultural sector through the development of agribusiness and better organized value chains, along the lines of its recent investment in a shea almond processing plant; proposing suitable financial products for local financial institutions and building their capacity to improve access to financing for underserved segments;  developing lower-cost renewable energy infrastructure; improving the business environment in general, with a view to attracting investors and developing the private sector.Last Updated: Apr 22, 2020"

        The following are some of the results obtained as a result of World Bank Group assistance:Safety NetsThe Emergency Safety Nets Project “Jigisemejiri” (tree of hope) aims to reduce poverty and food insecurity. Between 2013 and June 2019:79,168 families received quarterly cash transfers in the Gao, Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, Segou, Mopti, and Timbuktu regions and in the district of Bamako;105,000 persons received nutritional supplements (70% were children under 5 and 30% were pregnant women);10,000 households were able to support themselves through income-generating activities (small businesses, processing of agricultural products, livestock farming, market gardening, etc.);Project beneficiaries also have access to free health care through the national medical insurance scheme (RAMED) implemented by the National Agency for Medical Insurance (ANAM);The Unified Social Registry identified 350,000 vulnerable households eligible for contributory and non-contributory programs.60 highly labor-intensive community public works projects were carried out (construction of dikes and small dams; rehabilitation of community health centers and classrooms).Acces to Water and SanitationCurrently, 45% of Bamako’s residents do not have access to drinking water at home, while those who do, experience significant shortages. As part of a multi-donor program, the project to supply Bamako with drinking water from Kabala aims to provide safe drinking water to 95% of the population by 2025:New production and storage facilities have already significantly reduced shortages for more than 600,000 persons, who now have uninterrupted service;Launched in June 2019, the program to provide 110,000 social connections, 40,000 of which are funded by the World Bank, has already provided more than 80,000 persons with access to drinking water at home. In the coming months, this coverage will be extended to an additional 400,000 persons;By 2022, the program will cover more than 1.6 million persons and will also facilitate access to drinking water by close to 400,000 persons through more than 1,200 standpipes, 25% of which will be funded by IDA.Last Updated: Apr 22, 2020"

        Mali, a vast Sahelian country, has a low-income economy that is undiversified and vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations. High population growth rates (a fertility rate of six children per woman in 2017) and climate change pose major risks for the country’s agriculture sector and food security.After rising to 47.2% between 2011 and 2015 owing to the security crisis, the extreme poverty rate fell slightly to 42.7% in 2019 as a result of exceptionally high agricultural production in the past four years. Poverty is concentrated in the rural areas of southern Mali (90%), where the population density is the highest.Political ContextMali has been experiencing instability and conflict since the military coup of 2012 and the occupation of the northern regions by armed groups. The operations of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) date back to July 2014.President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, first elected in 2013, was reelected to a second term in August 2018. Parliamentary elections scheduled for the fall of 2018 were postponed several times. The first round took place on March 29, 2020, following an electoral campaign marked by the kidnapping of Soumaïla Cissé, head of the Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) opposition party, in Saraféré on March 25, 2020. In the first round, 12 of 147 representatives were reelected. The remaining 125 seats will be awarded following the second round scheduled for April 19, 2020.Peace negotiations between the government and two rebel coalitions, the “Platform” and the “Coordination,” concluded with the signing of an agreement in June 2015. This agreement provides for greater decentralization, creating a special development zone for Mali’s northern regions. It includes several projects, among them the program of accelerated development in the north (Programme de développement accéléré du Nord) and the emergency program for the revival of development in the northern regions (Programme d’urgence pour la relance du développement des régions du Nord). However, the country is encountering difficulties with the implementation of this agreement.Security, which is critical for economic recovery and poverty reduction, remains fragile in the face of continued attacks by armed groups on UN peacekeepers, the Malian army, and civilians, mainly in the north and central regions.In July 2017, Germany, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, France, the European Union, and the United Nations Development Programme launched the Sahel Alliance in order to provide a coordinated and tailored response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since that time, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.Economic OverviewThe impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the Malian economy has, thus far, been limited. As a net oil importer, the country is benefiting from the sharp drop in the price of crude. Mali's main export item is gold, a traditional safe haven in times of crisis. Consequently, the crisis is expected to lead to an improvement in its terms of trade, which would facilitate a reduction of the current account deficit.These potential positive effects must, however, be viewed in perspective, especially since Mali faces the risk of a collapse in the prices of its agricultural exports and lower demand in the Euro zone. Furthermore, if the direct effects of the slowdown in China’s economic activity on Malian exports are moderate, Mali could experience importation difficulties in a situation where international value chains are disrupted.Using a baseline scenario in which China and the European Union experience a modest economic downturn and oil prices decline by 25%, Mali’s GDP growth is projected to fall to 4.9% in 2020, against 5.1% in 2019.In a more pessimistic scenario in which oil prices decline by 50%, the global economy experiences a very sharp downturn, and the virus spreads significantly among the Malian population, the impact on the Malian economy would be far greater. Social distancing measures and the lack of medical infrastructure to cope with the health crisis would disrupt domestic economic activity, leading to a roughly 4% decline in real GDP growth.Mali has the fiscal and monetary space to implement countercyclical policies. It could, however, have difficulty sustaining itself financially in a context of global uncertainty and risk aversion on the part of investors. In the short term, it would be to the government’s advantage to redirect expenditure toward public health services and take steps to increase its sources of revenue, including revenue from international technical and financial partners.Last Updated: Apr 22, 2020","
        
        The World Bank Group works with Mali’s other technical and financial partners (bilateral and multilateral donors and the United Nations system on the ground). It also works closely with the private sector, civil society, municipalities, and universities.

        StrategyThe new framework selectively supports Montenegro’s development agenda, with a particular focus on creating employment and economic opportunities and restoring fiscal balance in order to accelerate long-term inclusive growth. Montenegro faces the significant challenge of creating good jobs for its people; solving this problem requires action to strengthen the sup-ply of labor as well as to increase the demand for labor from potential employers.Young job seekers need to be equipped with relevant skills, while less-skilled and more vulnerable segments of the population need access to opportunities and jobs.The overarching objective of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) new Country Partnership Frame-work covering the period FY16–20 is to support Montenegro on the path of more sustainable and inclusive growth.Today, the growing fiscal deficits and public debt levels are making it more difficult to finance long-term private sector development at a pace needed for Montenegro to become a prosperous high-income country and move forward with EU accession. Restoring macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability and strengthening the financial sector will be critical to ensuring a stable macro environment that stimulates private investment and job creation in the long term. Implement-ing these measures will also be an opportunity to improve the quality of public spending for more inclusive social and employment services for poor and vulnerable populations so that all Montenegrin citizens benefit from future development. Key EngagementBuilding on the successes of the original Montenegro Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening Project (MIDAS), in September 2016, the World Bank approved an additional financing loan in the amount of €3.0 million to further strengthen rural aeas and increase the country’s preparedness for EU accession requirements. This additional financing will allow for an expansion of the institutional capacity building achieved to date in order to manage public funds dedicated to agricultural support.The original MIDAS project has so far assisted in establishing Montenegro’s capacity to implement an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance in Rural Development (IPARD)-compatible system, a paying agency, a farm registry, and a pilot IPARD-like grant scheme supporting investments in agriculture holdings and the introduction of agri-environmental measures through five rounds of grants. Around 660 farmers, 60% of whom live in the poorer north, have received IPARD-like grants to enhance their agricultural production.The project also supported the strengthening of the country’s Food Safety System, including by developing the regulatory framework, building a Border Inspection Post, and upgrading national reference labs.MIDAS is also an example of excellent collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Montenegro, the EU, and the World Bank.

        Project SpotlightThrough the Montenegro Energy Efficiency Project (MEEP), the World Bank has supported the Montenegrin Government’s efforts to improve energy-efficiency performance in public sector buildings, energy-efficiency implementation practices and capacity in public institu-tions, and energy-efficiency service providers in the country.   MEEP is investing in energy saving retrofits in about 27 schools and hospitals. It is insulating roofs and buildings and upgrading heating systems, substations, and networks. Facilities were selected for retrofits based on their energy savings potential, geographic distribution, number of users, and social and demographic impact.The project has helped with the retrofitting of 20 education and health sector buildings. Social surveys of users show very high end-user satisfaction with the results as well as increased awareness of the importance of energy efficiency.As a result, savings in heating energy have ranged between 30% and 67%, with an average of 46.7%.

        A key regional player in West Africa, Nigeria accounts for about half of West Africa’s population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of youth in the world. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and culturally diverse federation which consists of 36 autonomous states and the Federal Capital Territory. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa’s biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent. The country held national elections in 2019, for the sixth consecutive time since its return to democracy in 1999. The incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari won the elections and was sworn in for a second term on May 29, 2019. He has identified fighting corruption, increasing security, tackling unemployment, diversifying the economy, enhancing climate resilience, and boosting the living standards of Nigerians as main policy priorities his government seeks to continue to pursue in his second term up till 2023. Nigeria’s federated structure gives significant autonomy to states.Oil price volatility continues to influence Nigeria’s growth performance. Between 2000 and 2014, Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 7% per year. Following the oil price collapse in 2014-2016, combined with negative production shocks, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate dropped to 2.7% in 2015. In 2016 during its first recession in 25 years, the economy contracted by 1.6%.Since 2015, economic growth remains muted. Growth averaged 1.9% in 2018 and remained stable at 2% in the first half of 2019. Domestic demand remains constrained by stagnating private consumption in the context of high inflation (11% in the first half of 2019). On the production side, growth in 2019 was primarily driven by services, particularly telecoms. Agricultural growth remains below potential due to continued insurgency in the Northeast and ongoing farmer-herdsmen conflicts. Industrial performance is mixed. Oil GDP growth is stable, while manufacturing production is expected to slow down in 2019 due to a weaker power sector performance. Food and drink output are expected to increase, likely in response to import restrictions. Construction continues to perform positively, supported by ongoing megaprojects, higher public investment in the first half of the year, and import restrictions.Growth is too low to lift the bottom half of the population out of poverty. The weakness of the agriculture sector weakens prospects for the rural poor, while high food inflation adversely impacts the livelihoods of the urban poor. Despite expansion in some sectors, employment creation remains weak and insufficient to absorb the fast-growing labor force, resulting in high rate of unemployment (23% in 2018), with another 20% of the labor force underemployed.  Furthermore, the instability in the North and the resulting displacement of people contribute to the high incidence of poverty in the North East.Without significant structural policy reforms, Nigeria’s medium-term growth is projected to remain stable around 2%. Given that the economy is expected to grow more slowly than the population, living standards are expected to worsen. Growth is constrained by a weak macroeconomic framework with high persistent inflation, multiple exchange rate windows and forex restrictions, distortionary activities by the central bank, and a lack of revenue-driven fiscal consolidation results. Rising public debt, and increasingly complex policy interventions by the central bank constrain private sector credit growth. External balances are fragile to hot money movements, and fiscal buffers are exhausted, making Nigeria’s economy vulnerable to external risks.The new government has the opportunity to accelerate the pace of structural reforms to build an institutional and policy framework capable of managing the volatility of the oil sector and supporting the sustained growth of the non-oil economy. Bold reforms that could have a significant impact on the economy’s trajectory are the removal of subsidies, elimination of forex and trade restrictions, greater transparency and predictability of monetary policy and increased domestic revenue mobilization. Such reforms would help raise living standards of low-income groups while increasing spending on much needed public services. The signing of the Africa Continental Trade Agreement, after extended deliberations, may also provide some positive momentum over the medium-term. Development ChallengesWhile Nigeria has made some progress in socio-economic terms in recent years, its human capital development remains weak due to under-investment and the country ranked 152 of 157 countries in the World Bank’s 2018 Human Capital Index. Furthermore, the country continues to face massive developmental challenges, which include the need to reduce the dependency on oil and diversify the economy, address insufficient infrastructure, and build strong and effective institutions, as well as governance issues and public financial management systems.Inequality in terms of income and opportunities has been growing rapidly and has adversely affected poverty reduction. The North-South divide has widened in recent years due to the Boko Haram insurgency and a lack of economic development in the northern part of the country. Large pockets of Nigeria’s population still live in poverty, without adequate access to basic services, and could benefit from more inclusive development policies. The lack of job opportunities is at the core of the high poverty levels, of regional inequality, and of social and political unrest in the country.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) continues to enjoy a strong partnership with Nigeria through a strategy to support the government in its development’s objectives to end extreme poverty and increase shared prosperity. During FY2018 and FY2019, the WBG support will focus on revenue diversification and mobilization, addressing the binding constraints for attracting private financing, and improving social services delivery for building the human capital needed for inclusive economic growth, in alignment with the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.The Country Partnership Strategy period (FY2014-FY2019) has an investment of $8.8 billion through the International Development Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Nigeria has been one of the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) fastest growing portfolio and represents IFC’s fifth largest global country exposure, with a committed volume of $1.8 billion. The WBG’s support for Nigeria is structured around several priorities which include promoting diversified growth and job creation with a focus on youth, women and the poor in marginalized areas and improving the quality and efficiency of social service delivery at the state level to promote social inclusion. It identifies as priority fostering macroeconomic resilience and advancing structural reforms for private sector-led, non-oil growth. This includes agricultural productivity and increased access to finance. The WBG also supports increased engagement in the climate resilient agenda.In the conflict-affected North-East Nigeria, the WBG is stepping up its support to addressing service delivery gaps, livelihood deficits and social cohesion issues, as well as providing support to the diversification of the economy. The Nigeria Electricity Transmission Access Project (NETAP) ($486 million) aimed at achieving a viable power sector through the rehabilitation and upgrading of Nigeria’s electricity transmission substations and lines.The Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) Program-for-Results ($611 million) credit aims to bring out-of-school children into the classroom, improve literacy, and strengthen accountability for results in basic education.Agro-Processing, Productivity Enhancement and Livelihood Improvement Support Project ($200 million) credit aims to further support the Government of Nigeria in its efforts to enhance agricultural productivity of small and medium scale farmers in participating states.Mineral Sector Support for Economic Diversification Project (MinDiver) ($150 million) credit aims to establish a strong foundation for mining sector development and enhance competitiveness by improving information infrastructure and knowledge, strengthening of key government institutions, and fostering of domestic investment in the sector.Multi-Sectoral Crisis Recovery Project for North Eastern Nigeria ($200 million) credit aims to support the Government of Nigeria’s response to the acute humanitarian and forced-displacement crisis triggered by the Boko Haram conflict in North East Nigeria.

With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa’s biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent. The country held national elections in 2019, for the sixth consecutive time since its return to democracy in 1999. The incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari won the elections and was sworn in for a second term on May 29, 2019. He has identified fighting corruption, increasing security, tackling unemployment, diversifying the economy, enhancing climate resilience, and boosting the living standards of Nigerians as main policy priorities his government seeks to continue to pursue in his second term up till 2023. Nigeria’s federated structure gives significant autonomy to states.Oil price volatility continues to influence Nigeria’s growth performance. Between 2000 and 2014, Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of 7% per year. Following the oil price collapse in 2014-2016, combined with negative production shocks, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate dropped to 2.7% in 2015. In 2016 during its first recession in 25 years, the economy contracted by 1.6%.Since 2015, economic growth remains muted. Growth averaged 1.9% in 2018 and remained stable at 2% in the first half of 2019. Domestic demand remains constrained by stagnating private consumption in the context of high inflation (11% in the first half of 2019). On the production side, growth in 2019 was primarily driven by services, particularly telecoms. Agricultural growth remains below potential due to continued insurgency in the Northeast and ongoing farmer-herdsmen conflicts. Industrial performance is mixed. Oil GDP growth is stable, while manufacturing production is expected to slow down in 2019 due to a weaker power sector performance. Food and drink output are expected to increase, likely in response to import restrictions. Construction continues to perform positively, supported by ongoing megaprojects, higher public investment in the first half of the year, and import restrictions.Growth is too low to lift the bottom half of the population out of poverty. The weakness of the agriculture sector weakens prospects for the rural poor, while high food inflation adversely impacts the livelihoods of the urban poor. Despite expansion in some sectors, employment creation remains weak and insufficient to absorb the fast-growing labor force, resulting in high rate of unemployment (23% in 2018), with another 20% of the labor force underemployed.  Furthermore, the instability in the North and the resulting displacement of people contribute to the high incidence of poverty in the North East.Without significant structural policy reforms, Nigeria’s medium-term growth is projected to remain stable around 2%. Given that the economy is expected to grow more slowly than the population, living standards are expected to worsen. Growth is constrained by a weak macroeconomic framework with high persistent inflation, multiple exchange rate windows and forex restrictions, distortionary activities by the central bank, and a lack of revenue-driven fiscal consolidation results. Rising public debt, and increasingly complex policy interventions by the central bank constrain private sector credit growth. External balances are fragile to hot money movements, and fiscal buffers are exhausted, making Nigeria’s economy vulnerable to external risks.The new government has the opportunity to accelerate the pace of structural reforms to build an institutional and policy framework capable of managing the volatility of the oil sector and supporting the sustained growth of the non-oil economy. Bold reforms that could have a significant impact on the economy’s trajectory are the removal of subsidies, elimination of forex and trade restrictions, greater transparency and predictability of monetary policy and increased domestic revenue mobilization. Such reforms would help raise living standards of low-income groups while increasing spending on much needed public services. The signing of the Africa Continental Trade Agreement, after extended deliberations, may also provide some positive momentum over the medium-term. Development ChallengesWhile Nigeria has made some progress in socio-economic terms in recent years, its human capital development remains weak due to under-investment and the country ranked 152 of 157 countries in the World Bank’s 2018 Human Capital Index. Furthermore, the country continues to face massive developmental challenges, which include the need to reduce the dependency on oil and diversify the economy, address insufficient infrastructure, and build strong and effective institutions, as well as governance issues and public financial management systems.Inequality in terms of income and opportunities has been growing rapidly and has adversely affected poverty reduction. The North-South divide has widened in recent years due to the Boko Haram insurgency and a lack of economic development in the northern part of the country. Large pockets of Nigeria’s population still live in poverty, without adequate access to basic services, and could benefit from more inclusive development policies. The lack of job opportunities is at the core of the high poverty levels, of regional inequality, and of social and political unrest in the country.

        StrategyNumber of Active Projects9IBRD$1.98 BillionUnder the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY19-23, the World Bank Group supports Romania’s efforts to accelerate structural reforms and convergence with the European Union (EU) through robust, sustainable, and equitable growth and enhanced competitiveness.The Bank engages in Romania with a full range of its instruments: development policy lending, investment lending, Performance for Results, Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA), and Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS).In response to COVID-19, the Government of Romania activated €400 million of pre-arranged financial support from the World Bank through the Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) facility that the Government negotiated with the World Bank in June 2018. Financing covers a range of interventions to strengthen health services, minimize the losses to both the public and private sectors, and safeguard lives and livelihoods. The Health Sector Reform Program has also been restructured to help the Romanian authorities to procure emergency supplies and equipment. In addition, the Romania Secondary Education (ROSE) Project was restructured to provide €40 million worth of equipment and materials to 1,100 high schools and over 60,000 vulnerable students to allow them access to online education. Key EngagementInternational Bank for Reconstruction and DevelopmentEngagement over FY19–23 has the overarching goal of strengthening Romania’s institutions, advancing poverty reduction, and promoting shared prosperity through three pillars:Equal opportunities for allPrivate sector growth and competitivenessResilience to shocksIn the past few months, the World Bank’s Romania Country Office has been working to adapt to the changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and has restructured the existing portfolio, especially in the health and education sectors.The Romania program consists of nine lending projects, 11 trust funds, and 58 ASA tasks, including:45 tasks corresponding to 36 RAS agreements that are signed and under implementationtwo RAS agreements that are under preparationthree non-RAS ASA (Bank Budget funded)eight non-RAS ASA (EU-funded trust funds)The active lending portfolio of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) amounts to $1.98 billion.The RAS program - one of the largest in the World Bank Group at $109.57 million - is focused on priority areas for Romania’s EU convergence, such as improved strategic planning and budgeting, evidence-based policy making, protection of the vulnerable, disaster risk management, human development, and strengthened capacity for monitoring and evaluation. It also features engagements supporting a number of municipalities, including Bucharest, Constanta, Brasov, and Cluj, as well as other subnational authorities, to enhance their capacity for planning and prioritizing investments and urban regeneration.International Finance CorporationThe International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) committed own account portfolio in Romania ranks second in the Europe and Central Asia region after Turkey. Since the start of operations in Romania in 1991, IFC has invested approximately $3.5 billion, including over $0.7 billion mobilized from partners, in over 110 projects. As of August 1, 2020, IFC’s committed portfolio in Romania was $814 million, of which 62 percent represented investments in financial institutions (banks, non-bank financial institutions) and the remaining 38 percent investments in the real sector. The outstanding portfolio is $744 million. In FY20, IFC’s commitments totaled US$334 million, including mobilization.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsThe economy contracted by 4.7 percent in the first half of 2020, driven by a decline of 10.5 percent in the second quarter. Imports contracted less than exports (down 9.4 percent), leading to a 21 percent increase in the trade deficit in the first half of the year. The weakening of external demand from Europe, alongside pandemic-related restrictions, caused industry to contract by 14.1 percent in the same time frame.Turnover in trade and services decreased by 17 percent in the first half of 2020, but high-frequency indicators point to a relatively quick rebound.The sharp decline in output has led to deteriorating labor market conditions, with deeper effects noted for younger workers and women. Job vacancies fell between the first and second quarters of 2020, while the unemployment rate increased to 5.4 percent in July from 4.1 percent in February. Job and household income losses were stemmed by the technical unemployment relief program, which covered 1.3 million beneficiaries during the state of emergency at a cost of approximately €370 million (0.2 percent of GDP).Rapid household assessments of the impact of COVID-19 show a substantial rise in the share of the population at risk of poverty in April 2020, as income-generating opportunities for the working poor and near poor declined, and nearly one-third of households reported income drops.   Economic Outlook The economy is expected to contract by 5.7 percent in 2020. The severity of the recession and the magnitude of the 2021 economic recovery will depend on: the evolution of the health crisis and its policy response, the impact of the national economic stimulus, and the spillovers from the stimulus pursued at the European Union (EU) level. Romania is expected to receive €79.9 billion from the EU by 2027. This amount would be obtained under the multiannual budget funds 2021–27 (€49.5 billion) and the economic recovery plan (€30.4 billion, of which €13.7 billion is in grants as reported by Romania’s Ministry of European Funds).The EU grant funds are budget neutral and will be critical to covering the fiscal gap of around 9 percent of GDP in 2020, up from a planned deficit of 3.6 percent before the crisis. A substantial reduction of the deficit in 2021 is improbable as the Government will have to support the economic recovery process. A widening fiscal deficit would push public debt to an estimated 45.1 percent of GDP in 2020 and 47.7 percent in 2021 from 37.6 percent in 2019. The bulk of the increase stems from the fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, Romania’s public debt remains one of the lowest in the EU.

        South Africa’s political transition is known as one of the most remarkable political feats of the past century. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has been driving the policy agenda since 1994. In August 2016 the country held the most competitive local government election since 1994 in which the ANC-lost majority support in four of the metropolitan cities. Political parties negotiated coalition deals that saw the ANC unseated in the cities of Johannesburg, Pretoria and Nelson Mandela Bay. The latest general elections were held in May 2019.The South African economy grew by 1.3% in 2017 and 0.8% in 2018. The World Bank projects 2019 growth at 1.3%, accelerating further to 1.7% in 2020. Given population growth, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth has been close to nil since 2014, leaving little room to reduce poverty. Commodity prices remain important for South Africa, a major exporter of minerals and importer of oil. Strengthening investment, including foreign direct investment, will be critical to propel growth and create jobs.Key Development ChallengesSouth Africa has made considerable strides toward improving the wellbeing of its citizens since its transition to democracy in the mid-1990s, but progress is slowing. Based on the international poverty line of $1.90 per day, (2011 Purchasing Power Parity, exchange rates), 18.8% of South Africans were poor in 2015, following a decline from 33.8% in 1996. Factors driving this progress include, among others, real income growth, expansion of social safety nets, access to basic services including subsidized housing credit. Yet progress towards poverty reduction has slowed in recent years, with the $1.90 per day poverty rate increasing from 16.8% to 18.8% between 2011 and 2015. This is partly due to structural challenges and weak growth since the global financial crisis of 2008, but increasingly too by labor market developments that demand skills that the country’s poor currently lack. Unemployment remains a key challenge, standing at 27.6% in the first quarter of 2019. The unemployment rate is even higher among youths, at around 55.2%.South Africa remains a dual economy with one of the highest inequality rates in the world, with a consumption expenditure Gini coefficient of 0.63 in 2015. Inequality has been persistent, having increased from 0.61 in 1996. High inequality is perpetuated by a legacy of exclusion and the nature of economic growth, which is not pro-poor and does not generate sufficient jobs. Inequality in wealth is even higher: the richest 10% of the population held around 71% of net wealth in 2015, while the bottom 60% held 7% of the net wealth. Furthermore, intergenerational mobility is low meaning inequalities are passed down from generation to generation with little change in inequality over time. Not only does South Africa lag its peers on level of inequality and poverty, it lags on the inclusiveness of consumption growth.

        A Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2014-2017, was discussed by the World Bank Group (WBG) Board in November 2013 and has been extended for a further year. The CPS is demand-driven and centered on knowledge and technical cooperation as well as support to the implementation of the ongoing lending program in energy and the environment.Anchored to the government’s National Development Plan, the CPS is primarily focus on the “three I’s”: reducing inequality, which responds to priorities in improving access and quality of public service delivery at the national level as well as in smaller cities and townships; promoting investments, refers to the large infrastructure deficit in the country, and ambitious plans to meet this demand through both public and private investments and; strengthening institutions, responds bolstering financial risk management through improving the capacity of public institutions.The WBG is currently preparing its next Country Partnership Framework, based on a Systematic Country Diagnostic, which the WBG developed in broad consultation with South Africans. The diagnostic identifies the following five binding constraints to reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity are: (i) insufficient skills; (ii) the skewed distribution of land and productive assets, and weak property rights; (iii) low competition and low integration in regional and global value chains; (iv) limited or expensive connectivity and underserviced historically disadvantaged settlements, and (v) climate change: transition to the low-carbon economy and water insecurity.

        The South Africa portfolio has five active projects valued at $4.1 billion, comprising two International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financed projects ($3.8 billion) and three trust-funded projects ($300m). The Eskom Investment Support Project ($3.75 billion) is the largest of the two-lending operation (82% disbursed to-date). Improving energy security and greening South Africa’s energy mix and preserving the country’s biodiversityThe Eskom Investment Support Project (EISP) seeks to enhance South Africa’s power supply and energy security in an efficient and sustainable manner. As of September 2019, five of the six units of the Medupi power plant were synchronized to the network, with four in commercial operation. It is expected that all six will be in commercial operation by May 2020. The earlier-commissioned units are experiencing latent defects, which Eskom is working with the contractors to resolve.An additional 100MW from the Sere Wind Farm went into commercial operation in May 2015 and is operating very well. The project has been restructured and extended to December 2020 to enable completion of an additional, battery storage, sub-component under the Renewable Energy component. Battery storage will assist in improving utilization of energy generated from variable renewable energy sources under the RE IPP program.The Eskom Renewables Support Project provides $250 million of Clean Technology Fund co-financing for the Renewable Energy component of the EISP and consists of the completed Sere Wind Farm and Battery Storage. The closing date was extended to December 2021 to allow enough time for completion of battery storage.Financial Sector DevelopmentThe second IBRD project is the Land Bank Financial Intermediation Loan Project ($93 million), which was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in January 2017. The Land Bank project aims to sustainably scale-up the Land Bank's financing in agriculture, especially to benefit emerging farmers. The project is a line of credit to support Land Bank in refocusing its operations on wholesale lending for agriculture financing through intermediaries. The project also supports Land Bank’s new approach to help integrate emerging farmers into established value chains. The disbursements under the project started in June 2018.Urban developmentA second Urban Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) Agreement worth $11.25 million supports government efforts aimed at turning around the apartheid spatial legacy of South African cities and improving spatial efficiencies. The above is a multi-global practice work program for metropolitan-level support, with a World Bank (WB) team acting as principal technical advisor to National Treasury (NT) on a range of critical policy areas identified under the Cities Support Program (CSP) at NT. The above complements the ongoing financial support from SECO (additional $9 million Bank-executed trust fund (BETF) signed in September 2015), in addition to a parallel engagement with the Ministry for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs ($2.2 million BETF), focusing on secondary and fast-growing cities. The SECO BETF is 85% disbursed and will be completed ahead of the closing date of 2020. A second $7.0 million SECO BETF agreement is being prepared in close coordination with National Treasury. This is expected to be concluded by December 2019.EducationThe 12th edition of the South Africa Economic Update: Tertiary Education Enrollments Must Rise: shows that enhancing South Africa’s socio-economic inclusion through equitable access to the tertiary education in a tight fiscal environment will require rebalancing financial support to students with comprehensively improving the quality and admission capacity of country’s post school education and training system. It asserts that strengthening the quality of education in Technical Vocation Education and Training, community colleges distant education institutions and historically disadvantaged universities will increase enrollment and expand admission capacity in a sustainable manner.

        StrategyWorld Bank Portfolio in TajikistanNumber of projects15IDA grants and credit$741 millionAbout the World Bank Group in TajikistanTajikistan joined the World Bank in 1993 and the International Development Association (IDA) in 1994. During this time, the World Bank invested over $1.4 billion to support Tajikistan’s efforts to reduce poverty and improve people’s lives.Over twenty-five years, the partnership with Tajikistan has evolved in line with changes in local needs and the global economy. Initially, the World Bank focused on post-conflict reconstruction projects in the late 1990s and provided emergency funding in response to food insecurity and natural disasters.Starting in 2000, investments have aimed to restore productivity-led growth and job creation through improved education, better access to healthcare and safe drinking water, enhanced land rights, diversification of agriculture in rural areas, and an improved business environment.Following the 2008 and 2014 economic shocks, which impacted Tajikistan through reduced remittances and lower export commodity prices, Bank support aimed at protecting the poorest households and creating income generation opportunities in rural regions.Subsequent strategies focused on supporting second generation reforms in agriculture, energy, health, and education, to increase acess to and quality of services for the population. At the same time, the World Bank Group worked closely with the government of Tajikistan, the private sector, civil society and development partners to improve the business environment, promote private investments for better job creation and create sources of sustainable economic growth.The current World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy aims to support Tajikistan’s transition to a new growth model led by investment and exports. The active World Bank portfolio in Tajikistan includes 16 projects (including regional projects) with a net commitment of $560 million. The largest share of the portfolio is in the energy sector (44%), followed by water (16%) and urban and rural development (12%). Other sectors supported by the Bank Group include transport, governance, agriculture, health, education, and social protection.Tajikistan and the World Bank Group are currently consulting on strategic priorities to be addressed jointly under the new Country Partnership Framework for 2019–23. This new strategy aims to support the country’s efforts to transform the economy along the “industrial-innovative scenario” spelled out in Tajikistan’s National Development Strategy to 2030.Tajikistan became a member of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1994. The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. Since 1997, the IFC has invested $152 million to support 40 private sector projects in the financial, hydropower, retail, tourism, and manufacturing sectors.The IFC’s Advisory activities focus on improving the business environment, promoting private sector development, strengthening the financial sector, supporting the improvement of corporate governance practices, promoting electronic and digital financial services, supporting agribusiness, and enabling private sector involvement in infrastructure. The IFC’s investment portfolio in Tajikistan stands at $32 million. The current portfolio comprises 45% in the financial market and 37% in telecommunications, while the rest is distributed among food, retail and agribusiness. Tajikistan’s portfolio is complemented by Trust Fund grants to the amount of $356 million. These grants cover important sectors including education, energy, agriculture, food security and social sectors. Some of the World Bank Group’s technical assistance in Tajikistan is financed directly by the country’s various bilateral and multilateral development partners.As an institution of global expertise in development, the World Bank Group invests heavily in research to understand country development experience and shares this cross-country knowledge through analytical and advisory services. In Tajikistan, over 100 publications have been produced on economic and other sector issues since 2000. In addition, advisory services have brought international experience to Tajikistan on private sector development, health, education, energy, agriculture, investment strategies, and climate change.Tajikistan became a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 2002. MIGA has not, so far, provided any political risk guarantees for investment projects in Tajikistan.

        EconomyNOTE: Our Spring 2020 Regional Economic Update was published on 8 April 2020, and includes analysis of the economic impact of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) on countries in the region.Learn more about how the World Bank Group is coordinating with partners to accelerate the international response and support countries to manage the global COVID-19 pandemic.--------------------------------------------------  Recent Economic DevelopmentsAccording to official statistics, GDP growth remained strong in 2019 at 7.5 percent. A jump in exports and a recovery in remittances helped narrow the current account deficit to an estimated 4.3 percent of GDP in 2019. Export earnings rose by 9.4 percent, supported by higher shipments abroad of precious metals and electricity.Delays in rolling out the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program to an additional 28 regions and slow progress on the decision to increase the TSA’s budget by 10 percent have put this important anti-poverty measure on hold.Except for two problem banks, the financial sector has continued on its recovery from the 2016 banking crisis, showing an improvement in the quality of the credit portfolio. The share of nonperforming loans stood at 26 percent at the end of 2019. Banking sector profitability also continued to improve, and the level of dollarization declined to 53 percent at the end of 2019 from a peak of 64 percent in 2015.The poverty rate—using Tajikistan’s official poverty line—fell to 27.4 percent in 2018, reflecting a recovery in remittance inflows. The rate of extreme poverty also fell steadily from 18 percent in 2013 to 12 percent in 2018.Economic OutlookThe COVID-19 outbreak and the closure of Tajikistan’s borders with its neighbors pose significant risks to the economy. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1 percent in 2020 or lower, reflecting the implications of the pandemic and the slowdown in Russia and China. These implications include a sharp decline in trade and lower commodity prices, a likely large drop in remittances, and worsened prospects for the transport and tourism industries. Growth will likely remain weak at about 3.5 percent in 2021–22, supported by public investment ahead of Tajikistan’s commemoration of 30 years of independence in 2021. Should the COVID-19 outbreak extend beyond the six months now underpinning the baseline scenario outlined above, the outlook will be much more negative. Growth could be nil in 2020 or even negative, and the pressure on the current account and fiscal deficits will increase. Prospects for poverty reduction will be undermined by the increase in food prices and the fall in the growth rate and remittances.Structural challenges in the Tajik economy also weigh on the country’s development prospects. Governance issues in the state-owned enterprises—including in key sectors of the economy—present high quasi-fiscal risks and threaten the sustainability of public finances. Delays in implementing much-needed structural reforms to improve the business environment will continue to hinder private sector development.The construction of the Rogun Hydropower Plant from budget proceeds continues to present a serious risk to macro-fiscal sustainability and to further squeeze social spending.Tax reform efforts, the power utility rehabilitation program, and financial sector reform—if implemented successfully—could improve the country’s fiscal management and business environment over the medium term.The Government could accelerate progress in reducing extreme poverty by expanding the TSA to those regions currently not covered by the program and by augmenting the TSA to compensate poor households for utility tariff increases.

        ALL PROJECTSHighlighted ProjectThe Second Public Employment for Sustainable Agriculture and Water Management ProjectIn Tajikistan, irrigated agriculture is critical for food security and for rural livelihoods. More than 90 percent of agriculture production is from irrigated lands and over half the workforce is engaged in the agriculture sector, contributing to almost 20 percent of GDP.“When I set up my dehkan farm in 2012, it was not easy. We saw the harvest dying, as we did not receive sufficient water for our crops,” says farmer Zulfiya Ishmirzoeva. “Disputes over who will get water first were common among the farmers.”The Second Public Employment for Sustainable Agriculture and Water Management Project (PAMP II) supported the Government of Tajikistan in improving water resource management at the local, basin, and national levels. Key to improved irrigation was the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and support to Water Users Associations, which are community-based organizations linking farmers to an irrigation service provider. The project also supported improved payment and financial accountability practices between the farmers, Water Users Associations, and bulk irrigation service providers through the introduction of a billing system. Training and new equipment for all these groups further helped to improve water planning and the delivery of irrigation services.The US$57.9 million for the project, financed by IDA and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, covered 17 of the most food insecure districts in Tajikistan. Approximately 1.4 million people living in these districts have benefited from improved irrigation services and better water management.

        Zambia is large, landlocked, resource-rich country with sparsely populated land in the center of Southern Africa. It shares its border with eight countries (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) that serve as an expanded market for its goods.Zambia is experiencing a large demographic shift and is one of the world’s youngest countries by median age. Its population, much of it urban, is estimated at about 17.9 million and growing rapidly at 2.8% per year, partly because of high fertility, resulting in the population doubling close to every 25 years. This trend is expected to continue as the large youth population enters reproductive age, which will put even more pressure on the demand for jobs, health care and other social services.Economic OutlookAfter 15 years of significant socio-economic progress and achieving middle-income status in 2011, Zambia’s economic performance has stalled in in recent years. Between 2000 and 2014, the annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate averaged 6.8%. The GDP growth rate slowed to 3.1% per annum between 2015 and 2019, mainly attributed to falling copper prices and declines in agricultural output and hydro-electric power generation due to insufficient rains. In 2019, economic growth declined significantly, from 4% (2018) to 1.4%. The services sector remained the country’s key driver of growth, growing by 3.5% in 2019, but primary and secondary sectors decreased significantly .The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has exacerbated Zambia’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The country is Africa’s second largest copper producer; depressed commodity markets have pushed copper prices down by about 14% through May 2020. The supply chain breakdown in major trading partners such as China and South Africa is negatively affecting domestic production and consumption. The Kwacha has depreciated by 30% since the beginning of the year, increasing external debt servicing costs and domestic inflationary pressures. Falling revenues and increased COVID-19-related spending will worsen the 2020 fiscal position, and falling exports and capital inflows will put additional pressure on foreign exchange reserves.As a result, the economy is projected to contract by about 4.5% in 2020. Mining and services sectors will be impacted by the global commodities demand and price outlook and increased social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The current account deficit is expected to worsen to 3.4% of GDP, while lower copper export earnings and capital inflows will put pressure on reserves and the Kwacha.Domestically, increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and related social distancing measures could overwhelm the health system and result in massive business and job losses, especially in the urban informal sector.Political ContextZambia is considered a stable country with successful democratic elections held every five years. The current President is Edgar Chagwa Lungu of the Patriotic Front Party who was re-elected in August 2016, in a closely contested presidential race with his main rival, Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development (UPND).The next elections will be held in August 2021.

        Zambia is large, landlocked, resource-rich country with sparsely populated land in the center of Southern Africa. It shares its border with eight countries (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) that serve as an expanded market for its goods.Zambia is experiencing a large demographic shift and is one of the world’s youngest countries by median age. Its population, much of it urban, is estimated at about 17.9 million and growing rapidly at 2.8% per year, partly because of high fertility, resulting in the population doubling close to every 25 years. This trend is expected to continue as the large youth population enters reproductive age, which will put even more pressure on the demand for jobs, health care and other social services.Economic OutlookAfter 15 years of significant socio-economic progress and achieving middle-income status in 2011, Zambia’s economic performance has stalled in in recent years. Between 2000 and 2014, the annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate averaged 6.8%. The GDP growth rate slowed to 3.1% per annum between 2015 and 2019, mainly attributed to falling copper prices and declines in agricultural output and hydro-electric power generation due to insufficient rains. In 2019, economic growth declined significantly, from 4% (2018) to 1.4%. The services sector remained the country’s key driver of growth, growing by 3.5% in 2019, but primary and secondary sectors decreased significantly .The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has exacerbated Zambia’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities.

        World Bank Country Partnership Strategy for ZambiaThe World Bank Zambia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY19-23 supports the government in achieving its development goals, and is closely aligned with the government’s  National Development Plan and Vision 2030.The CPF is underpinned by the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), conducted in 2017 to augment the World Bank’s understanding of the mechanism needed for poverty reduction in Zambia.The CPF focus areas are:Increase opportunities and jobs for the Rural PoorIncrease public Services and Social Protection to build a healthy and skillful workforceBuild Resilient InstitutionsZambia ranks among the countries with highest levels of poverty and inequality globally. More than 58% (2015) of Zambia’s 16.6 million people earn less than the international poverty line of $1.90 per day (compared to 41% across Sub-Saharan Africa) and three quarters of the poor live in rural areas.Currently, the World Bank portfolio in Zambia has 14 projects with a total commitment of $1.2 billion. Agriculture accounts for 18% of the World Bank portfolio, infrastructure (roads, water and electricity), accounts for about 60% of the Bank’s portfolio, and the average life of a project is 3.8 years. The other sectors are currently as follows: environment (11%), agriculture (10%), finance and private sector development (8%), the public sector (8%), and human development (5%). Grants now account for about 18%of the current total net commitments while credits are at 82%.The International Finance Corporation (IFC)The IFC has a significant portfolio in Zambia, mostly in agribusiness and financial services as well as manufacturing. The current IFC portfolio in Zambia includes 13 projects, totaling $86.5 million, which is made up of an investment portfolio of $55.9 million and pipeline to the value of $155.8 million. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) are also providing support for Zambia’s development.The Multilateral Investment Guarantee AgencyMIGA has about $106 million in commitments in Zambia and guarantees are helping agriculture, livestock and aquaculture development. A MIGA guarantee for Agrivision Africa (formerly Chayton Africa) is helping a large commercial farm in the Copperbelt Province to achieve efficient agricultural practices and expand capacity of a grain processing facility, thereby providing substantial demonstration effect to other farms.MIGA has also supported the Silverlands Fund through a multi-country Master Reinsurance Contract with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in Silverlands Ranching Limited which is helping improve and develop a large cattle farm in Zimba, Southern Province.Regional Trade FacilitationZambia has committed to implementing policy reforms to enhance regional trade. Zambia is part of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) bodies that promote regional trade. Overall, Zambia has performed well in all dimensions of the regional integration index, ranking second in COMESA and fourth in the SADC region.The Bank’s response to COVID-19 in ZambiaZambia’s location in Southern Africa—surrounded by eight countries—increases the risk of imported diseases from neighboring countries and beyond. This is because Zambia is a major trucking route for goods, both for import and export, as well as a destination and transit point for labor migrants, asylum seekers, illegal migrants, and victims of human trafficking in the region increase the risk of COVID-19 community transmission and spillover into Zambia.The Bank is providing $25 million to support Zambia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of this amount, $20 million will come from the crisis response window resources, while $5 million is grant from the Global Financing Facility. The funds will be channeled through the Zambia COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Project.

        StrategyNumber of projects11Lending US$638 millionIBRD 11 Loans (US$603 million)IDA Lending US$35 millionGrants 9 (US$19 million)The current World Bank Group program in Albania is guided by the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY15–20, which provides analysis, advice, and financing in support of equitable growth in Albania and integration into the EU. The CPF, which has been extended to end-FY2021, is focused on three main areas: restoring macroeconomic balancescreating conditions for accelerated private sector growthstrengthening public sector management and service deliveryRoughly 80 percent of the program has already been delivered. The ongoing portfolio is supporting the Government’s main priorities and is also being adjusted to respond to the earthquake and COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing Health System Improvement Project will be restructured, and additional financing will help respond to the Government’s request for hospital reconstruction in the affected areas. The Emergency Covid-19 Project was approved by the Board on July 30, 2020. Discussions with the Government are under way on how best to manage the COVID-19 emergency, considering both short- and long-term interventions.    A Fiscal and Growth Development Policy Loan in the amount of US$80 million is expected to be negotiated by mid-October. It focuses on critical structural reforms to support restructuring and a resilient recovery. Beyond its direct financing contribution, this operation also aims to help Albania crowd in and leverage private sector financing by providing an anchor for critical structural reforms and acting as a signal of Albania’s continued commitment to fiscal sustainability and growth. Key Engagement Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Albania are significant contributors to the Albanian economy, accounting for 99.8 percent of active enterprises, employing 79.8 percent of the workforce, and realizing approximately 69 percent of value added. This sector is generally characterized by high informality, the limited availability of collateral, and low levels of financial capability. The restrained access to finance, particularly bank credit, poses a challenge for MSMEs in Albania. Public credit guarantee schemes (CGSs) are a common form of government intervention to unlock financing for MSMEs. More than half of all countries in the world have a CGS for MSMEs, and the number is growing. CGSs can contribute directly to the expansion of MSME finance and can also encourage banks and non-bank financial institutions to get into the MSME market. CGSs can be leveraged to provide countercyclical financing to MSMEs during a downward economic cycle, such as the one induced by the current pandemic, when financial institutions may become unwilling to lend. To this end, the Government, supported by technical assistance from the World Bank, has launched two emergency CGS windows in support of COVID-19-affected firms and started to explore the potential for a permanent public CGS. The World Bank carried out an assessment of CGSs in Albania with the aim of identifying weaknesses and offering recommendations on how to improve existing and future facilities. A virtual workshop was organized in July 2020, jointly with the Albania Investment Council and Ministry of Finance and Economy, to present the main findings of the CGS Assessment Report and also to discuss ways to improve MSMEs’ access to finance through these schemes. The report provided insights and suggestions, based on best CGS international practices and principles, in the event that the Government decides to develop CGSs in support of MSMEs. Number of Active Projects9LendingUS$544 millionIBRD9 loans (US$509 million)IDA lendingUS$35 millionGrants8 ($17 million)Number of Active Projects9LendingUS$544 millionIBRD9 loans (US$509 million)IDA lendingUS$35 millionGrants8 ($17 million)Number of Active Projects9LendingUS$544 millionIBRD9 loans (US$509 million)IDA lendingUS$35 millionGrants8 ($17 million)

Enhanced regional connectivity and access to regional and global markets, coupled with export and market diversification, can also help promote faster growth. In addition, the Government of Albania has been working on a broad-based reform program focused on macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability, financial sector stabilization, energy reform, social assistance and disability reform, and territorial decentralization.Albania was hit by a devastating earthquake on November 26, 2019. In response, a donor’s conference was organized in Brussels in February 2020, and roughly €1 billion was pledged from countries and international financial institutions. In the midst of these reconstruction efforts, the COVID-19 crisis is putting more pressure on the Government’s budget and response. The World Bank and other partners are cooperating to support the Government in overcoming these challenges and implementing the country’s longer-term development goals.

        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSThe two significant shocks that have recently affected the economy—the devastating 2019 earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic—dominate the stage of recent economic developments. As the country started its reconstruction phase, the global pandemic forced it to put key economic sectors in lockdown. The tourism sector, a key driver of growth, was hit especially hard because of containment measures and travel restrictions. GDP contracted by 2.5 percent in the first quarter of 2020. Investment contracted sharply by 16.7 percent, while consumption growth was marginal at 1.1 percent. Net exports decreased by 8.13 percent.The crisis has been reflected in the labor market. In the second quarter of 2020, employment declined by 3.6 percent year-on-year, unemployment rose to 11.9 percent, and labor force participation declined. The earthquake and the pandemic are expected to significantly increase poverty in 2020, with resulting poverty rates comparable to those in 2005.In the midst of increased expenditure on social protection, public investment has also increased, with the aim of mitigating the impact of the pandemic and addressing earthquake damage, while revenues have decreased mainly because of the fall in economic activities. The combination of lower revenues and a higher fiscal deficit will cause Albania’s public debt to increase to an expected 81.4 percent of GDP in 2020.The decrease in tourism inflows and exports of goods and services, together with lower incomes, declining textile processing orders, and lower oil prices, widened the current account to roughly 12.1 percent of GDP in the second quarter of 2020.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKAlbania’s GDP is expected to contract by 8.4 percent by the end of 2020. Assuming a containment of the pandemic by the end of the year, GDP is forecasted to recover by 5 percent in 2021 as exports, consumption, and investment partially rebound. In the coming year, private consumption will play an increasingly important role in growth, supported by earthquake reconstruction efforts. Services, led by tourism, and construction are expected to be key growth drivers.  With economic activity picking up, revenues are projected to reach before-crisis levels of 27.6 percent of GDP by 2022–25. Albania’s public debt is projected to gradually decline over the medium term.  The employment outlook is largely dependent on the recovery of the services sectors and the level of reconstruction investments. Poverty will continue to affect around one-third of Albanians in the medium term unless new jobs have higher value added and higher wages.The current account deficit is expected to decrease to 10.1 percent of GDP in 2021 and further decline to 8 percent, in line with pre-crisis trends. At the same time, service exports, including tourism and the fast-expanding business process operations, are expected to recover, infrastructure investment to speed up, and foreign direct investment inflows in tourism, energy, and manufacturing to increase.

        The World Bank is a long-term strategic partner of Argentina. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2019-2022 seeks to contribute to reducing poverty through promoting sustainable and inclusive growth.The main areas of work are: 1. Supporting the country in the creation of long-term private financing sourcesThe WBG supports fiscal consolidation and the strengthening of market institutions (such as competition, trade and investment frameworks), promote productivity-led growth and an increase in exports. The development of a nascent local capital market and the mobilization of financing for key investments are also strategic priorities, together with the strengthening of the social safety net. 2. Contributing to improving public sector management and service provisionEnhancing the efficiency of public administration is another key area of the strategy. It will do so by seeking to strengthen inter-jurisdictional coordination with the goal of improving basic public service delivery such as water and sanitation. Moreover, it prioritizes the education sector, with the aim of improving learning outcomes in secondary education and skills building capacity to enter the labor market. It continues also to support the implementation of a universal healthcare coverage system in the provinces.3. Promoting actions to reduce the country’s vulnerability to climate changeIn terms of climate change, the CPF supports the transition to a low carbon economy, increasing electricity generation from renewable sources and promoting the adoption of climate smart agricultural practices. At the urban level, it seeks to increase urban resiliency by  promoting the use of electric buses.

        Argentina has an active portfolio of 22 investment projects with USS6.2 billion in committed loans, a guarantee for US$466 million and two grants for an amount of US$10 million. The portfolio focuses on supporting programs in the areas of health, environment, education, infrastructure, labor market and social protection.During the last year, the World Bank Board of Directors approved several projects, among which are:A US$ 35 million emergency loan to support government efforts to minimize the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on the health system through the purchase of medical supplies and equipment.An additional financing for the Child and Youth Protection Project (US$ 300 million), with the aim of minimizing the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable and reaching 350,000 children who are not yet included in family allowance programs;An additional financing of US$ 245 million to continue the sanitation of the Matanza-Riachuelo basin, through sewerage works, reduction of industrial pollution and flood control, in order to improve the quality of life of 4.3 million of inhabitants.In addition, the World Bank continues to implement the Children and Youth Protection Project (US$ 1 billion), with the objective of reaching 250,000 children who are not yet included in family allowance programs; and the Supporting Effective Universal Health Coverage Project (US$ 300 million) which promotes equitable access of 15 million people to quality health services.In order to get 20 percent of Argentina's energy from clean sources by 2025, two guarantees of US$730 million were put in place to support the Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER). The development of renewable energy in Argentina is key to diversify the energy matrix and contribute to climate change mitigation.In the rural area, several projects stand out: the Integrated Risk Management in the Rural Agroindustrial System Project (US$ 150 million), which aims for 20,000 vulnerable producers to increase their resilience to climate events, such as droughts and floods, and the Renewable Energy Project in Rural Areas (US$ 200 million), which seeks that isolated communities access electricity through clean energy. In the north of the country, about 900,000 inhabitants are improving road connectivity thanks to the Northwest Development Corridor Road Project (US$300 million)The World Bank is also carrying out a number of analytical studies to help achieve sustained poverty reduction in Argentina. The latest reports focus on topics such as agriculture, environment, pensions, subsidies, and cities, among others. Latest Reports: Country environmental analysis (Spanish)Boosting the potential of Argentine cities: framework for public policy action (Spanish)Arreglos institucionales para la producción de estadísticas de pobreza (Español)Agricultural sector in Argentina (Spanish)Soy logistic Argentina-Paraguay-Uruguay (Spanish)The incidence of subsidies to residential public services in Argentina: the subsidy system in 2014 and some alternativesArreglos institucionales para la producción de estadísticas de pobreza (Spanish)

        When the commodities boom ended, Bolivia relied on large public spending and increasing domestic credit to maintain strong economic growth despite the decline in gas export prices and volumes. These measures increased public debt and gradually reduced the macroeconomic buffers accumulated during the economic boom. Additionally, the deterioration of the international context reduced the pace of the reduction of poverty and inequality.Currently, Bolivia is dealing with the global COVID-19 crisis. Officials have implemented several economic initiatives to protect the most vulnerable population, including cash transfers, the deferment of some tax payments, financial sector credits, and the partial payment of utility bills. Notwithstanding, the global economic downturn, exacerbated by the sharp drop in oil prices and social distancing measures, including a national quarantine, resulted in an economic contraction and an uptick in poverty. The economy is expected to contract by 7.3 percent in 2020, and poverty, measured with the international poverty line of 5.5 international dollars a day, is expected to increase by near nine percentage points, from 22 to 31 percent. This is partly because the country policy room was restricted by reduced macroeconomic buffers and  delays in the approval of external credits to deal with the emergency. In this context, authorities tapped into the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) to finance both the public and the financial sectors.Given the health emergency, all possible mechanisms should be employed to reduce the human cost of the crisis and create an enabling environment for an economic recovery. However, the post-crisis challenges require Bolivia to consolidate macroeconomic stability by reducing its fiscal and external deficits, promote the development of private investment to diversify the economy and create quality jobs, and establish mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable and to make families more resilient to shocks.

        When the commodities boom ended, Bolivia relied on large public spending and increasing domestic credit to maintain strong economic growth despite the decline in gas export prices and volumes. These measures increased public debt and gradually reduced the macroeconomic buffers accumulated during the economic boom. Additionally, the deterioration of the international context reduced the pace of the reduction of poverty and inequality.Currently, Bolivia is dealing with the global COVID-19 crisis. Officials have implemented several economic initiatives to protect the most vulnerable population, including cash transfers, the deferment of some tax payments, financial sector credits, and the partial payment of utility bills. Notwithstanding, the global economic downturn, exacerbated by the sharp drop in oil prices and social distancing measures, including a national quarantine, resulted in an economic contraction and an uptick in poverty. The economy is expected to contract by 7.3 percent in 2020, and poverty, measured with the international poverty line of 5.5 international dollars a day, is expected to increase by near nine percentage points, from 22 to 31 percent. This is partly because the country policy room was restricted by reduced macroeconomic buffers and  delays in the approval of external credits to deal with the emergency. In this context, authorities tapped into the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) to finance both the public and the financial sectors.Given the health emergency, all possible mechanisms should be employed to reduce the human cost of the crisis and create an enabling environment for an economic recovery. However, the post-crisis challenges require Bolivia to consolidate macroeconomic stability by reducing its fiscal and external deficits, promote the development of private investment to diversify the economy and create quality jobs, and establish mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable and to make families more resilient to shocks.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) program in Bolivia is guided by the fiscal year 2016-2020 Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The current portfolio of World Bank financing operations focuses on transport, health, rural development and agriculture, climate change, social protection and employment.The World Bank portfolio includes eight active projects for nearly US$1.200 million. Also, under the CPF, new operations are being prepared and are expected to be reviewed by the Board of Directors between 2019 and 2020 for approximately US$360 million in the areas of urban resilience and water and sanitation, among others.A Performance and Learning Review of the CPF was presented to the Board of Executive Directors in June 2018 introducing adjustments in the Framework’s pillars and objectives:Pillars:Promote broad and inclusive growth.Support environmental sustainability and resilience to climate change.Objectives:Reduce transportation costs and increase connectivity of isolated, vulnerable communities in selected areas to the road network;Increase access to certain quality basic services in low-income urban and rural communities;Improve opportunities for income-generation, market access and sustainable productivity gains;Improve the information base to provide quality data for public policy planning and evaluation.Strengthen the capacity for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, reducing vulnerability to natural disasters.The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the WBG agency that supports private sector development, will continue to focus on investments in the financial, agribusiness, manufacturing and services sectors. These investments seek to promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and foreign trade and to protect natural resources through the implementation of good global practices in environmental sustainability.

        Opportunities to generate income, access markets and increase productivityThe Rural Alliances Project II (PARII) supported producers’ organizations in rural areas. Between 2013 and 2018 the project benefited 20,490 families in 120 municipalities through 630 alliances aimed at enhancing the production capacity and market access of producers, including bridge and rural paths construction, among others. The benefited households increased their sales by more than 30 percent. The construction of 14 bridges facilitated access to markets to thousands of producers in the nearby areas. An additional financing (AF), approved in 2017, focuses on a more resilient agriculture and aims to reach producers nationwide, promoting productivity improvements, mainly by means of investments in automated irrigation.  With this new commitment, more than 26,000 families will reap benefits. So far, the PAR II AF has received more than 2,000 requests from producers’ organizations.   Within the framework of the Community Investment in Rural Areas Project (PICAR), 656 extremely poor rural communities of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, La Paz and Oruro (169,232 people) benefitted from 769 infrastructure sub-projects, half of which were managed by women. Additional project financing that includes Potosí will give an estimated 200,000 more people access to basic, productive and service infrastructure by the end of 2019.In the employment sector, the Project to Improve Employability and Labor Income for Youth works to promote employability of thousands of low-income youth and improve their labor income by supporting the expansion of young people’s entry into the labor market programs and developing their socio-emotional abilities, among others. A large percentage of women participate in this project. Mothers are given special stipends to help them raise their children under five years of age while they are working.Access to quality basic services in the poorest urban and rural communitiesThe Health Services Network Project’s goal is to improve access to and quality of healthcare services for 3.8 million Bolivians, giving priority to women, children and indigenous populations. It will implement a comprehensive hospital management system through the strengthening of health networks, complemented by training of healthcare professionals, application of clinical care standards, information systems and the construction and equipping of nine secondary hospitals, one tertiary care hospital and an emergency center in the Hospital de Clínicas in la Paz, which is a regional referral health facility.Capacity to manage climate change and reduce vulnerability to natural disastersThe Climate Resilience Project – Integrated Watershed Management aims to build institutional capacity for climate change adaptation, expanding the surveillance system of climate change effects, as well as strengthening the structure of the climate and water information system and drought monitoring. The project also works in three basins of Cochabamba Department, an area of approximately 16,000 square kilometers with a population of 1.4 million. Interventions include irrigation and defense, as well as integrated micro-basin management.Institutional capacity to improve public policies managementThe Project to Strengthen Statistics Capacity and the Information Base for Evidence-based Planning (STATCAP) promoted a new stage for statistical production with a modernization approach. Supported the implementation of a population and housing census in 2012, the agricultural census in 2013, the improvement of household surveys, the update of multipurpose maps, the Demographic and Health Survey 2016 and the 2015-2016 Household Budget Survey, among others. Additionally, it supported the implementation and dissemination of economic surveys for the manufacturing, commerce and services industry, micro and small economic units from September 2018 to May 2019. To complement these activities, the World Bank contributed in the computation of Consumer Price Index (CPI) required to estimate poverty rates. Currently, is collaborating on analytical activities related to poverty measurements.Connectivity and reduction of transportation costs for isolated, vulnerable communitiesTo increase connectivity and access to services, the Project for the Highway of the Santa Cruz Connection Corridor (the 208-kilometer San Ignacio-San José section) will finish construction on a highway of the road network linking Bolivia and Brazil, which completes the tourist circuit of Chiquitanía and forms part of the East-West Bi-oceanic Corridor.The Road Sector Capacity Development Project will contribute to road infrastructure while strengthening capacities for its sustainability. Supports the rehabilitation and maintenance of the 546-kilometer Santa Cruz–Trinidad road, which will benefit some three million residents of Santa Cruz and Beni departments, as well as users from other regions, most of whom are farmers who need to transport their produce to other markets. Moreover, it will promote the institutional strengthening of the Bolivian Roads Administration (ABC), developing its capacities to plan, prioritize and implement infrastructure investments in a holistic way with a new hiring approach for the country that includes the periodic and routine rehabilitation and maintenance of roads in a single operation.The National Highways and Airport Infrastructure Project aims to support regional and international integration through the construction of the 114-kilometer San Buenaventura – Ixiamas road. The road will link the departments of La Paz and Pando with Brazil, promoting the economic development of local populations. The project will also finance improvements to the Rurrenabaque Airport, which will facilitate the flow of tourism in the region.

Economic activity was led mainly by the services sector, the growth of which offset the decline in activity in the agricultural, mining, and construction sectors.Inflation fell from 2% in 2018 to -3.2 % in 2019 owing to the combined effect of a good crop year, which led to a decline in food prices, and lower telecommunications costs.The fiscal deficit improved in 2019 (-2.6%), thus falling below the 3% figure stipulated in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criteria, despite the increase in security expenditure, owing mainly to higher non-tax revenue (the sale of 3G licenses) and the decline in capital expenditure resulting from the slowdown in infrastructure projects.Gross financing needs were covered mainly by budget assistance and the issuance of bonds on the domestic and regional markets. Overall, public debt is sustainable and Burkina Faso’s risk of global and external debt distress continues to be moderate.Medium-Term Projections Without taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which has not yet been assessed, growth is projected to fall slightly to 5.8% in 2020, with this downward trend continuing owing to the security and humanitarian crisis. These projections will be impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, climate events, the worsening of the security and humanitarian crisis and, in the event of a global recession, the possible decline in cotton prices.Inflation is expected to increase to over 2%, as security threats could reduce the food supply.

Three main factors will contribute to this expected surplus: the increase in gold exports, the decline in oil imports, and the consolidation of the government budget, which is expected to contribute to lower demand for imports.Last Updated: May 04, 2020","
        
        The World Bank Group’s work in Burkina Faso is determined by a Country Partnership Framework that is reassessed every five years. This strategy, which is aligned with the objectives of the government’s economic and social development plan, is also based on a Systematic Country Diagnostic. The current framework (2018-2023) focuses on three objectives:Developing human capital and social protection systems;Accelerating economic growth and job creation through the promotion of the private sector in particular;Strengthening governance and promoting citizen engagement.In March 2020, the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Group institution that provides aid to the world’s poorest countries, was financing roughly 30 projects, 20 of which are national and 8, regional, representing a total commitment of $2.5 billion.To help Burkina Faso cope with fragility, conflict, and violence, IDA is providing it with additional concessional resources, the biggest amount being a $700 million allocation to support prevention and resilience efforts over the next three years.On April 30, 2020, the World Bank also approved $21.15 million in emergency financing from IDA— a 50% grant and 50% credit—to help Burkina with its response to the coronavirus pandemic.The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector development arm of the World Bank Group, is focusing on:Assisting with efforts to improve the business climate and attract private investment;Financing the development of small and medium enterprises, the agribusiness industry, infrastructure, energy, health, and the financial sector.Despite the security risks, IFC increased its annual commitments from $11 million to $135 million between FY2013 and FY2018.

        Burkina Faso is a low-income Sahelian country with limited natural resources.  Its economy is largely based on agriculture, which employs close to 80% of the working population, although gold exports have increased in recent years. Despite the progress made in the past two decades, Burkina Faso faces many development challenges, particularly in terms of health and education. It ranks 144th among 157 countries in the new human capital index  established by the World Bank and 40.1% of the population lives below the national poverty line. Furthermore, insecurity linked to frequent terrorist attacks since 2016 has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.Political ContextGrowing insecurity, particularly in the north, close to the border with Mali and Niger, has displaced many residents of Burkina Faso. In January 2019, fewer than 50,000 people were internally displaced, while in March 2020, this number stood at roughly 765,000.  At that time also, more than 2,000 schools were closed, a situation that deprived some 300,000 students of an education and impacted more than 11,000 teachers.In July 2017, the African Development Bank, the European Union, France, Germany, the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank launched the Sahel Alliance with the aim of providing a coordinated and tailored response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since then, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 2020. For the first time in the country’s history, citizens of Burkina Faso in the diaspora will be able to vote from abroad.Economic OverviewDespite the security and humanitarian crisis, the macroeconomic framework remained broadly stable in 2019. Although real GDP growth fell slightly, it remained fairly strong at 6%, compared to 6.8 % in 2018. Economic activity was led mainly by the services sector, the growth of which offset the decline in activity in the agricultural, mining, and construction sectors.Inflation fell from 2% in 2018 to -3.2 % in 2019 owing to the combined effect of a good crop year, which led to a decline in food prices, and lower telecommunications costs.The fiscal deficit improved in 2019 (-2.6%), thus falling below the 3% figure stipulated in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criteria, despite the increase in security expenditure, owing mainly to higher non-tax revenue (the sale of 3G licenses) and the decline in capital expenditure resulting from the slowdown in infrastructure projects.Gross financing needs were covered mainly by budget assistance and the issuance of bonds on the domestic and regional markets. Overall, public debt is sustainable and Burkina Faso’s risk of global and external debt distress continues to be moderate.Medium-Term Projections Without taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which has not yet been assessed, growth is projected to fall slightly to 5.8% in 2020, with this downward trend continuing owing to the security and humanitarian crisis. These projections will be impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, climate events, the worsening of the security and humanitarian crisis and, in the event of a global recession, the possible decline in cotton prices.Inflation is expected to increase to over 2%, as security threats could reduce the food supply. However, it is projected to remain below the 3% limit set by WAEMU.The current account deficit is projected to increase but to remain fairly well controlled and stable at roughly 4.5% of GDP during the 2020-2022 period.

        Water and Sanitation SectorBurkina Faso has achieved notable results in the water and sanitation sector, which the World Bank has been supporting for more than 15 years.As a whole, the efforts undertaken in this sector are of direct benefit to more than 1.7 million people. In June 2018, the World Bank approved an unprecedented $300 million in financing aimed at improving the access, sustainability, and efficiency of water and sanitation services in urban and rural areas, ultimately benefiting 2.4 million people.Rural DevelopmentThe Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project (PAPSA) has boosted the yields of small producers and expanded their access to financing. The project has directly benefited some 800,000 people, 32% of whom were women. In total, close to 11,000 hectares of land were developed for rice production, with 52% allocated to women. These investments helped boost national rice production by 10%. Maize and cowpea yields also increased by 49% and 50% respectively.Under this project, small-scale farmers were granted $2.3 million in loans.

        The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic started in Egypt in March 2020, and has since interrupted a period of macroeconomic stability, characterized by relatively high growth, improved fiscal accounts, and a comfortable level of foreign reserves. The pandemic hit as longstanding challenges continued to persist, notably the government’s elevated debt-to-GDP ratio (despite its significant reduction in recent years), sluggish revenue-mobilization, and a budget structure unfavorable to the nature of the crisis, with limited allocation scheduled for key sectors such as health and education, limited job-creation in the formal sector, and the below-potential performance of non-oil merchandise exports and non-oil FDI.Economic activity slowed with social distancing measures and the temporary suspension of air traffic. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) declined to 38.3 during the period April to June 2020, its lowest level on record, indicating a large contraction in non-oil private sector activity. The number of employed individuals declined by 2.7 million during the same period, pushing unemployment to 9.6% from 7.7% the previous quarter, with job losses, especially among informal workers, reported mainly in retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, tourism, transport and construction. The government allocated an emergency response package worth LE100 billion (1.7% of GDP) to augment health expenditure, scale-up social protection, and provide financial relief for individuals and businesses. Key measures included a one-off monetary grant to irregular workers and the expansion of existing cash transfer programs. Forbearance measures were introduced in the form of delayed tax filing and loan repayments, in addition to subsidized credit for targeted sectors. The Central Bank of Egypt slashed policy rates by a cumulative 350 basis-points since March 2020 to ease liquidity. Inflation has been declining since end-2019 and has remained rather contained, registering an average of 5.7% in the fiscal year 2020 (from an average 19.6% in the previous three), reflecting subdued demand and the general decline of global commodity prices, including oil. Foreign reserves dropped sharply due to large-scale capital outflows at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, in addition to the drop in tourism, Suez Canal revenues, and merchandise exports. Egypt has mobilized external financing, including a US$2.8 billion stopgap loan, issued under the IMF’s Rapid Financing Instrument; a US$5.2 billion Stand-by Arrangement (of which the first US$2 billion tranche was disbursed); and a US$5 billion sovereign Eurobond, a US$0.75 billion sovereign Green-bond, and US$2 billion loan from a UAE-led commercial bank consortium. Reserves remain ample, at US$38.4 billion by the end of August 2020 (7 months of merchandise imports), albeit below its pre-crisis peak of US$45.5 billion at end-February 2020. The exchange rate depreciated marginally from LE15.7/US$1 in February 2020 to just below LE16/US$ as of August 2020, with the authorities tolerating a drain on reserves in the intervening months to absorb some of the pressure experienced by many emerging markets. Growth, expected to have remained positive, declined from 5.6% in fiscal year 2019 to 3.5% in fiscal year 2020. Under a scenario that the pandemic will persist through early-2021, growth is projected to decline further to 2.3% in fiscal year 2021 before rebounding in fiscal year 2022. Private consumption in the near-term is expected to remain constrained; household incomes are affected by a combination of the economic downturn, increased joblessness, and salary cuts. Subsequently, poverty is forecast to increase, particularly in urban areas. And, since high-skilled, formal sector jobs were relatively shielded (whereas informal ones were adversely impacted by the crisis), inequality is also expected to rise. While remittances may initially react countercyclically (as expats increase one-off transfers), they are expected to eventually decline, notably with the economic downturn in Gulf countries. The current account deficit is thus projected to widen before starting to improve by fiscal year 2022, especially if the expected decline in remittances outweighs the projected narrowing of the net exports deficit. On the other hand, the capital and financial account is projected to remain buoyed by foreign borrowing, although FDI may decline, exacerbating a long-standing weakness in the amount of FDI going into traded goods’ sectors. The recent trend in fiscal consolidation is also expected to be temporarily disrupted. The budget deficit is estimated to have widened to LE476.8 billion, equivalent to 8.2% of the projected GDP in fiscal year 2020, up from 8.1% of GDP in fiscal year 2019. This was mainly driven by the decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio and exacerbated by economic contraction and postponed tax payments. Subsequently, government debt is projected to increase (from the already elevated 90.2% of GDP at end-fiscal year 2019), before starting to moderate once again as fiscal consolidation is resumed by fiscal year 2022. The multi-dimensional health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic underscores the importance of advancing both the human capital agenda and the country’s crucial need to strengthen social protection. A second wave of pending reforms, designed to unleash private sector activity and address Egypt’s long-standing structural challenges, is crucial to create better employment opportunities and improve livelihoods.

The pandemic hit as longstanding challenges continued to persist, notably the government’s elevated debt-to-GDP ratio (despite its significant reduction in recent years), sluggish revenue-mobilization, and a budget structure unfavorable to the nature of the crisis, with limited allocation scheduled for key sectors such as health and education, limited job-creation in the formal sector, and the below-potential performance of non-oil merchandise exports and non-oil FDI.Economic activity slowed with social distancing measures and the temporary suspension of air traffic. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) declined to 38.3 during the period April to June 2020, its lowest level on record, indicating a large contraction in non-oil private sector activity. The number of employed individuals declined by 2.7 million during the same period, pushing unemployment to 9.6% from 7.7% the previous quarter, with job losses, especially among informal workers, reported mainly in retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, tourism, transport and construction. The government allocated an emergency response package worth LE100 billion (1.7% of GDP) to augment health expenditure, scale-up social protection, and provide financial relief for individuals and businesses. Key measures included a one-off monetary grant to irregular workers and the expansion of existing cash transfer programs. Forbearance measures were introduced in the form of delayed tax filing and loan repayments, in addition to subsidized credit for targeted sectors. The Central Bank of Egypt slashed policy rates by a cumulative 350 basis-points since March 2020 to ease liquidity. Inflation has been declining since end-2019 and has remained rather contained, registering an average of 5.7% in the fiscal year 2020 (from an average 19.6% in the previous three), reflecting subdued demand and the general decline of global commodity prices, including oil. Foreign reserves dropped sharply due to large-scale capital outflows at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, in addition to the drop in tourism, Suez Canal revenues, and merchandise exports. Egypt has mobilized external financing, including a US$2.8 billion stopgap loan, issued under the IMF’s Rapid Financing Instrument; a US$5.2 billion Stand-by Arrangement (of which the first US$2 billion tranche was disbursed); and a US$5 billion sovereign Eurobond, a US$0.75 billion sovereign Green-bond, and US$2 billion loan from a UAE-led commercial bank consortium. Reserves remain ample, at US$38.4 billion by the end of August 2020 (7 months of merchandise imports), albeit below its pre-crisis peak of US$45.5 billion at end-February 2020. The exchange rate depreciated marginally from LE15.7/US$1 in February 2020 to just below LE16/US$ as of August 2020, with the authorities tolerating a drain on reserves in the intervening months to absorb some of the pressure experienced by many emerging markets. Growth, expected to have remained positive, declined from 5.6% in fiscal year 2019 to 3.5% in fiscal year 2020. Under a scenario that the pandemic will persist through early-2021, growth is projected to decline further to 2.3% in fiscal year 2021 before rebounding in fiscal year 2022. Private consumption in the near-term is expected to remain constrained; household incomes are affected by a combination of the economic downturn, increased joblessness, and salary cuts. Subsequently, poverty is forecast to increase, particularly in urban areas. And, since high-skilled, formal sector jobs were relatively shielded (whereas informal ones were adversely impacted by the crisis), inequality is also expected to rise. While remittances may initially react countercyclically (as expats increase one-off transfers), they are expected to eventually decline, notably with the economic downturn in Gulf countries. The current account deficit is thus projected to widen before starting to improve by fiscal year 2022, especially if the expected decline in remittances outweighs the projected narrowing of the net exports deficit. On the other hand, the capital and financial account is projected to remain buoyed by foreign borrowing, although FDI may decline, exacerbating a long-standing weakness in the amount of FDI going into traded goods’ sectors. The recent trend in fiscal consolidation is also expected to be temporarily disrupted. The budget deficit is estimated to have widened to LE476.8 billion, equivalent to 8.2% of the projected GDP in fiscal year 2020, up from 8.1% of GDP in fiscal year 2019. This was mainly driven by the decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio and exacerbated by economic contraction and postponed tax payments. Subsequently, government debt is projected to increase (from the already elevated 90.2% of GDP at end-fiscal year 2019), before starting to moderate once again as fiscal consolidation is resumed by fiscal year 2022. The multi-dimensional health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic underscores the importance of advancing both the human capital agenda and the country’s crucial need to strengthen social protection. A second wave of pending reforms, designed to unleash private sector activity and address Egypt’s long-standing structural challenges, is crucial to create better employment opportunities and improve livelihoods.

        The World Bank Group’s current engagement with Egypt is guided by its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2015–19 and Performance and Learning Review (PLR), which have resulted in the extension of the CPF to 2021 and which focus on fighting poverty and inequality. These are informed by rigorous analysis of the key constraints to both poverty reduction and creating shared prosperity, and by extensive consultations with the government, the private sector, academia, civil society organizations, and youth groups. The CPF comprises three, interconnected, strategic focus areas consistent with the Government of Egypt’s longer-term development strategy: i) improving governance, ii) improving opportunities for private sector job creation, and iii) social inclusion. The CPF was designed to remain flexible so that it could respond to the country’s evolving needs while offering world class expertise on integrated development solutions customized to Egypt’s specific context. The two-year extension granted as part of the PLR (endorsed by the Board of Directors in May 2019), positions the World Bank Group to build on its existing strategy by focusing on mobilizing finance for development and human capital development, and on enabling the transition to a digital economy. The extension supported a key goal of the Bank’s Regional Strategy—the renewal of the social contract—by addressing regional disparities through interventions in Egypt’s lagging regions, and by strengthening the social safety net system, improving accessibility to low-income housing, expanding access to water and sanitation services (especially in rural areas) and household natural gas, and moving ahead with education and health reform programs. The World Bank’s current portfolio in Egypt comprises 13 projects (10 IPFs and 3 PforRs), with commitments totaling US$5.84 billion. The World Bank Group is preparing a new Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD) to inform the new CPF 2021–2025, with job creation and socio-economic inclusion the core theme. The new CPF will address priorities identified by the SCD and the Country Private Sector Diagnosis (CPSD), in addition to providing relevant analytical tools and utilizing global knowledge, financial resources, strong partnerships, and the Bank’s convening power to help the people of Egypt reap the fruits of their patience.

        The Government of Egypt, supported by the World Bank Group, has achieved significant results across all three focus areas under this CPF. Policy reforms—backed by the US$3.15 billion Development Policy Finance (DPF) program and consisting of 3 operations over the 3 years of 2015 to 2017—have supported Egypt’s homegrown reforms’ program, which is aimed at enhancing the economy, creating jobs, and achieving sustainable growth, especially in the energy sector. Government revenues have been bolstered through the Income Tax Law while expenditures have been brought under control, especially on wages and salaries (through annual budget instructions and the automation of salary payments) and on energy subsidies (through annual tariff adjustments for gas and electricity). The environment for investors has been strengthened by amending the Investment Law, implementing the Competition law, and reforming the industrial licensing regime, which helped reduce the time taken in providing licenses to low risk industries by 80%. The World Bank Group has been supporting the Government of Egypt to mitigate any adverse effects the first wave of reforms may potentially have on the poor and the middle class. The Bank has helped design and finance key flagship projects and programs to do this, using financial instruments to: (i) enhance social protection programs; (ii) support sustainable job creation activities; and (iii) improve quality service provision in the country. Its active interventions include:The Bank has supported the government in designing and scaling up social safety net programs, including the Takaful and Karama cash transfers’ program. Due to the success of this program, US$500 million in Additional Financing for Egypt’s social safety net program was signed for on September 11, 2019. The program has reached about 3.1 million households (around 11 million citizens); its total financing is US$900 million. The program has expanded its coverage during the pandemic, adding 160,000 households. The project will boost the reach and efficiency of Takaful and Karama by piloting models aimed at economic inclusion for poorer households that provide job training and links to economic opportunities. Pilot programs will have a special focus on women and youth. The Upper Egypt Local Development Program for Results (US$500 million) is working to improve the business environment for private sector development and the local government’s capacity for quality infrastructure and service delivery to citizens and local firms in two of Egypt’s poorest governorates, Qena and Sohag, which have a combined population of 8 million. The program has supported about 4,000 firms through interventions, including the digitalization of administrative services for construction permits and business licenses, resulting in a 25% decrease in the time required to obtain them, as well as an increase in occupancy rates in industrial zones (of 23% in Qena and 5 % in Sohag). So far, infrastructure and service investments are estimated to have benefited about 5 million citizens, of whom about half are women. Citizens, including women and youth, are involved in identifying sources of capital investment through consultations held with almost 5,000 local citizens to date. The Household Gas Connections Project will provide 2.3 million of households in rural areas with a reliable, lower cost, grid-connected natural gas supply by 2021. Over 1.5 million households have already been connected, including over 286,000 poor households eligible under the project for subsidized connection costs. The project supports the institutional development of the gas sector by increasing digital development at the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company, and by developing a regulated natural gas market. The Sustainable Rural Sanitation Services Program, (US$850 million, including Additional Financing), will bring sanitation to about 1.73 million people in highly polluted villages and satellite areas of Sharkia, Dakhaliya, Beheira, Menoufia, Damietta, and Gharbia governorates in the Nile Delta, through household connections and wastewater treatment facilities. The program empowers and incentivizes local water and sanitation companies to deliver effective, inclusive, and accountable decentralized services, and is laying the groundwork for the sustainable development of the sector by developing its strategy and supporting regulatory and tariff reforms. It has reached 14,000 households to date, with over 150,000 household sanitation connections under construction. The Inclusive Housing Finance Program-for-Results (US$500 million) aims to improve the affordability of formal housing for low-income households in Egypt and strengthen the Social Housing and Mortgage Finance Fund’s capacity to design policies and coordinate programs in the social housing sector. As of June 2020, the program has supported the delivery of demand-side subsidies to 314,000 households across Egypt’s 27 governorates, with a 75% disbursement ratio. The program has contributed to greater social and youth inclusion: over 20% of beneficiaries are women, 70% are below the age of 40, and 18% below the age of 30. It has also prioritized families, with 57% married couples with young children. Analysis of its performance shows that, on average over the past four years, more than 75% of beneficiary households were from the lowest 40% income bracket. Another US$500 million in Additional Financing was signed for by the Government of Egypt on July 5, 2020, with parliamentary approval obtained and presidential ratification pending. The Bank-supported Egypt COVID Response Project (US$50 million) was signed off on, on July 6th, 2020, and will focus on immediate operational challenges and critical areas identified as key gaps in Egypt’s national response. Project funds will complement the activities of Egypt’s COVID-19 response plan by supporting costs associated with: (i) procuring and distributing medical equipment, including ICU and laboratory testing equipment and supplies, infection control products, and PPE; (ii) “Corona incentive pay” for healthcare personnel undertaking COVID-19-related tasks or serving at COVID-19 facilities, or specific costs related to the mobilization of health teams and hazard/indemnity pay (consistent with the government’s policies as per paragraph 36 of the COVID-19 SPRP); (iii) health worker training; (iv) operations of designated quarantine, isolation, and treatment centers; (v) mobilization of rapid response teams in contact tracing; (vi) development of contextualized messaging platforms and tools; (vii) innovative M&E for social distancing strategies, including community mobilization; and (viii) devising and adopting proper policy tools to optimize the country’s response to COVID-19.The Supporting Egypt’s Universal Health Insurance System (UHIS) project was approved by the Board on June 16, 2020. The project will support Egypt to implement the new UHIS as envisioned in the newly passed Universal Health Insurance Law. The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance through a Project Management Unit and four newly formed UHIS organizations: (i) the Universal Health Insurance Agency, which serves as the ”purchaser”; (ii) the Healthcare Organization, which serves as the “provider”; (iii) the General Authority for Healthcare Accreditation and Regulation, the “accreditor” responsible for quality assurance and accreditation; and (iv) the Egyptian Authority for Standard Procurement and Medical Technology Management, the “public procurer” responsible for buying drugs, medical equipment and other supplies for the public sector. The project will support Phase I of the rollout of the UHIS in 6 governorates: Port Said, Suez, Ismailia, South Sinai, Luxor, and Aswan. The 6 governorates are home to about 6 million people, out of Egypt’s total population of nearly 100 million.The Promoting Innovation for Inclusive Financial Access Project (US$300 million) expanded access to finance for micro- and small enterprises in underserved regions using innovative financing mechanisms, with a special focus on youth and women. The project closed in December 2019. Over its 5-year lifespan, the project issued loans to 174,808 Egyptians, of which 42% were women, 43% were under the age of 35, and 42% were in underserved regions. The number of businesses launched (from loans) created 303,213 jobs. In April 2019, the World Bank approved a successor project, Catalyzing Entrepreneurship for Job Creation (worth US$200 million) that will continue creating jobs and improving economic opportunities for Egyptians, again with a focus on women and youth. This project provides a comprehensive package of financial and non-financial support to traditional MSMEs, innovative start-ups, and high-growth firms. It went into effect in January 2020.The Education Reform Project (US$500 million) supports a major government effort to improve teaching and learning conditions in public schools, with a focus on: (i) improving kindergarten education; (ii) enhancing the capacity of teachers and educational leaders; (iii) the intensive use of digital resources for teaching and learning; and (iv) the introduction of a new, computer-based secondary school exit examination regulating access to universities. To date, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education has achieved the following: (a) the expansion by more than 40% of teachers trained under the teachers’ professional behavior training; (b) developing and administering new computer-based tests for grade 10 and grade 11 students nationwide; and (c) the training of staff to create an item bank, manage the administration and marking of the tests, and make the grade 10 and grade 11 scores available electronically less than a month after students are assessed, to students, directorates, districts, and school principals. Using the UK Trust Fund, the World Bank has provided technical assistance for a kindergarten Diagnostic Study to identify the strengths and opportunities in teaching practices. The Egypt National Railways Restructuring Project (US$600 million, including Additional Financing), supports the government and Egyptian National Railways (ENR) to improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of railway services by modernizing signals and investing in new tracks. The project has introduced measures to strengthen ENR’s management capacity and restructure operations to address the railway sector’s responsiveness. An estimated 1.4 million passengers will benefit from improved railway services daily on a high-density, passenger traffic corridor. The signaling component includes work on 640 km of track and 120 railway stations along the Cairo–Alexandria and Beni Suef–Asyut–Nag Hammadi lines.The Greater Cairo Air Pollution and Climate Change Project (US$200m) will contribute towards resilient and sustainable recovery that includes specific COVID-19 measures in support of government efforts to mitigate health and environmental hazards. Activities are focused on building responsiveness and resilience into institutions and systems, with an emphasis on the health sector (treating and minimizing contaminated waste) and service sector (enhancing worker safety and raising awareness on the link between respiratory infections and air pollution). The project aims to support an integrated climate and air quality management plan for Greater Cairo; the construction of an integrated waste management facility; and the financing of a demonstration low/no emission e-bus transport fleet and activities related to running it. These are expected to reduce the burden of air pollution on health and the economy. Development policy operations have supported reforms to move away the government’s focus away from subsidized goods to market-based solutions. The reforms support changes to the business environment with the goal of promoting private sector-led growth for job creation and improving accountability and transparency. Sound fiscal consolidation, supported by this DPF, has allowed the Government of Egypt to redirect its fiscal savings to the conditional cash transfers program, food subsidies, and social pensions programs. A follow-up DPF supports measures to improve access to finance and strengthen financial inclusion, especially for small firms and entrepreneurs, through the creation of a movable collateral registry (the first in the Middle East).A rich program of Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) helps identify and implement reforms in Egypt. These include:Supporting the government to strengthen human capital development by improving key aspects of social protection, education, and health programs, such as drafting social protection policies aimed at efficiency and effectiveness. A strategy for higher education will be produced to aid the employability of public university graduates and prepare them for opportunities provided in a more dynamic business climate and private sector. This will explore options for the sustainable and equitable financing of the public higher education system as well. Outside of this, dialogue and technical assistance will be given on topics such as food subsidies, pensions, and migration. The work will culminate in a Human Capital Strategy.  To improve Egypt’s competitiveness and promote private sector-led, inclusive growth, the program includes other advisory services and technical assistance offered to promote knowledge and capacity in private and financial sector development, and to expand the analytical foundation of the World Bank Group’s operations in Egypt. Last Updated: Oct 01, 2020"

        The smallest country in Central America, El Salvador has a population of 6.4 million (plus over 1.5 million Salvadorians living abroad) and is one of the most densely populated countries, ranking in the 83rd percentile worldwide in terms of population density.GDP growth in El Salvador reached 2.3 percent in 2019, but the country has been suffering from persistently low levels of economic growth. Annual GDP growth has exceeded 3 percent only twice since 2000 and averaged just 2.3 percent in recent years.The country had recently registered a moderate poverty reduction. The poverty rate (based on a US$5.5 per person per day poverty line) declined from 39 percent in 2007 to 29 percent in 2017. Extreme poverty (US$3.2 per person per day) also declined from 15 percent to 8.5 percent over the same period.El Salvador also became a more equal country in recent years, with the second-highest level of equality in Latin America and the Caribbean, after Uruguay, on par with the world average. Inequality –measured by the Gini coefficient– declined from 0.51 in 2001 to 0.38 in 2018.However, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant negative impact, even though El Salvador was the fastest country in Central America to adopt strong containment measures against the outbreak and remains among the least affected in the region.The Government also took steps to limit the pandemic’s impact on households and businesses. Measures included cash transfers to approximately 60 percent of all households; food distribution for low-income households; payment deferrals for basic utilities, mortgages and personal loans; extensions on income tax payments for individuals and applicable firms; lowering banks’ reserve requirements for newly issued loans, and the temporary relaxation of lending conditions through a grace period for loan repayments, among others. The Government also invested in strengthening the capacity of the public health system, renewed various health care centers and built a new hospital specializing in COVID-19 treatment.The pandemic will negatively impact poverty reduction and economic growth, as El Salvador’s GDP is expected to contract by 8.7 percent in 2020, due to diminished economic activity, decreased aggregate demand in international markets and a reduction in remittances sent to households mainly from the United States. An economic growth of 4.9 percent is expected in 2021.Crime and violence also threaten social development and economic growth in El Salvador and are among the main factors driving Salvadorians to migrate. Nevertheless, murder rates have declined dramatically since August 2019, bringing the country’s violence indicators towards the regional average.El Salvador has also a high exposure to natural hazards, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It is also highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including more frequent occurrences of floods, droughts, and tropical storms.Despite these challenges, El Salvador has great potential to bolster its economic growth. The country’s strategic location, with access to many markets, a growing labor force, and a solid industrial base could support the expansion of the trade sector to achieve stronger and more inclusive growth. Development goals could be achieved with a long-term commitment to structural reform, quality job creation and investment in human capital.

        Since COVID-19 struck, the World Bank has been working intensely on fast, broad actions to limit harm and help countries, including El Salvador, prepare for recovery and rebuilding better and stronger than before, by focusing on four priorities:    i) saving lives threatened by the pandemic;    ii) protecting the poor and vulnerable;    iii) securing the foundations of the economy to shorten the time to recovery; and    iv) strengthening policies and institutions for resilience based on transparent and sustainable debt and investments.The current World Bank lending portfolio in El Salvador totals US$720 million and includes four investment projects (three pending Legislative approval) to support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, boost resilient local economic development and support early childhood health and education.The lending portfolio is complemented by trust-funded operations in the health and environment sectors, as well as advisory services and analytics in areas such as trade facilitation, e-government and disaster risk management, among others.The World Bank also plans to update its Systematic Country Diagnostic, a comprehensive assessment of El Salvador's growth and poverty reduction challenges for the coming years. This analysis will serve as a reference for adapting the World Bank's work program in El Salvador.

        The Education Quality Improvement Project expanded the adoption of the Inclusive Full Time School (IFTS) Model in 29 municipalities in the country. The project supported the construction of 32 schools with refurbished infrastructure, the renovation of 563 school facilities (classrooms, libraries, study rooms, teacher rooms, sports and recreation spaces) and the provision of educational material and equipment to 195 schools to adopt the IFTS model. The project benefited more than 151,000 students and teachers, including 6,259 students in grades 7 to 9 who received more than 30 hours per week of additional pedagogical activities with the IFTS model, and about 2,500 teachers who got certified in pedagogical skills such as art, physical education, and indigenous cultures, among others.The Strengthening Public Health Care System Project supported the expansion of the Integrated Health Care Services Model in the 82 poorest municipalities of the country. Project results include the construction of the first national radiology center for cancer treatment, procurement of 44 fully-equipped ambulances, improved management of medical waste in 30 hospitals, the development of the first national strategy for chronic diseases and the creation of the national directorate of chronic diseases within the Ministry of Health. During the implementation of the project, more than 1,300 pregnant women and 14,000 children under age 3 received maternal and childcare services. Also, around 85,000 people benefited from immunization vaccines and close to 8,000 chronic kidney patients received treatment kits. The project also supported the training of over 4,660 health staff.The Local Government Strengthening Project benefited around 3.4 million people across 262 municipalities through the development of 507 local infrastructure projects, such as electrification, clean water and sanitation, waste management, construction and improvement of roads, and bridges, as well as renovation of sports and recreation spaces to support violence prevention programs. In addition, these local infrastructure projects generated around 12,987 temporary jobs.Through the Income Support and Employability Project, the World Bank financed the government’s Temporary Income Support Program (PATI), which benefitted approximately 41,000 people living in poverty with temporary community jobs and technical training. The program was initially implemented in 25 municipalities and later expanded to eight more in 2015. The project also supported the Ministry of Labor in establishing 49 employment offices to offer job placement services to beneficiaries, along with mobile employment kiosks, employment fairs, and an on-line jobs portal serving around 200,000 persons overall.The Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project rehabilitated three hospitals and reconstructed another three, which were either destroyed or damaged during two earthquakes in 2001. The project also conducted preventive maintenance of hospitals and improved hospital services to over 3 million beneficiaries. Through community outreach programs, the project extended health and nutrition services to 1.2 million women, children, and indigenous people in 141 poor municipalities.The Protected Areas Consolidation and Administration Project updated the National Strategy and ActionPlan for consolidating and managing the Natural Protected Areas System and tested it in two pilot protected areas (Bahia de Jiquilisco and San Diego-Las Barras). The project prevented deforestation and promoted regeneration on over 20,207 hectares. Both protected areas were delineated, and land tenure conflicts were reduced.

        EconomyEritrea’s recent growth performance has been marked by significant volatility in part due to its dependence on a predominantly rain-fed agriculture sector, accounting for about one-third of the economy (and which has a significant impact on distribution services which account for around 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), and on a narrow mining sector which also accounts for 20% of the economy. Real GDP growth is estimated to have recovered to around 12% in 2018, while averaging -2.7% during 2015-18 on account of frequent droughts and a decline in mining production.  Reported inflation has been negative during 2016-18, following the exchange of currency in circulation in November 2015 that resulted in a monetary contraction. Deflation continued in 2018 as increased trade with Ethiopia resulted in further put downward pressure on prices.In recent years, Eritrea has significantly tightened fiscal policy to reverse the chronic deficits it suffered after the increase in regional insecurity in 1998. In 2018, the fiscal surplus widened to around 11% of GDP in 2018. This was largely achieved by a sharp drop in capital spending as well as some revenue measures. However, fiscal pressures, both recurrent and wage-related are likely to mount.Short-term growth prospects remain challenging given fiscal constraints and limited opportunities under existing restrictions.

        The overriding goal of the World Bank Group (WBG) is to support the reduction of extreme poverty and improve the prospects for more shared prosperity in Eritrea. After a hiatus of several years, the Government of Eritrea has recently reopened dialogue with the World Bank on renewed development cooperation.In response, the World Bank is preparing a Country Engagement Note which would chart the pathway to broader reengagement with Eritrea, to identifying the most critical constraints and opportunities facing the country and to future areas of cooperation. Given Eritrea’s current lack of access to International Development Association financing on account of outstanding repayment arrears, the WBG program will seek to finance future activities through trust funds, partnerships, and the World Bank’s own budget.

        The Bank’s engagement in Eritrea in recent years was in the Ports Rehabilitation Project for the rehabilitation and upgrading of the Massawa and Assab ports. The project, with a World Bank investment of $30.3 million, closed in December 2011 having achieved all its activities. It enabled the government to substantially increase the productivity of Port Massawa. Bulk cargo handling increased by 71% from a base of 850 tons per ship per day in 1997 to 1,457 tons, which was well above the target of 1,100 tons. Break bulk handled increased from 170 tons per ship per day to 286 tons, a growth of 68% and above the project target of 260 tons. The port handles eight 20-ft equivalent unit (TEU) containers per hour, up from only three, but the target of 12 TEU/hr was not achieved.The project financed the extension of the container terminal and berths at Port Massawa, and also acquisition of new port equipment and spare parts. It improved the access of the port by rehabilitating and expanding the Sigalet and Dahlak causeways. Modern environmental management practices were introduced at the port and supported with acquisition of environment management equipment. It also facilitated the emergency repairs on the old jetty, thereby holding these facilities from collapse and securing petroleum products supplies to Eritrea. The only pending contract under the project was the construction of a new jetty and associated supervision works, which was terminated by the government before the closure, citing poor performance by the contractor. Eritrea has achieved universal primary education, but access remains an issue at the pre-primary, middle and secondary school levels, as does quality across all levels of schooling. Eritrea attained the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary with gross enrollment ratio (GER) at 107% in 2015/16.  However, only about one in five children have access to pre-primary education. Middle school GER is 75% and secondary school GER 28%.  Eritrea also has a strong tradition in health care where its indicators compare favorably with Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Eritrea was one of only two low-income SSA countries to achieve all health-related MDGs by 2013 and also achieved the \"Roll Back Malaria\" targets. During 2000-13, the country saw a 67% reduction in under-five mortality, 78% reduction in maternal mortality (ratio), 82 and 69% reduction in HIV prevalence and deaths respectively, 85 and 90% reductions in malaria incidence and deaths; and 62 and 61% reductions in tuberculosis incidence and deaths.  A tradition of social mobilization has helped to achieve remarkable progress against Female Genital Mutilation which has been widespread and impressive “last mile” results, e.g. raising DPT3 immunization coverage from 76 to 94% by 2017.

        EconomyEritrea’s recent growth performance has been marked by significant volatility in part due to its dependence on a predominantly rain-fed agriculture sector, accounting for about one-third of the economy (and which has a significant impact on distribution services which account for around 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), and on a narrow mining sector which also accounts for 20% of the economy. Real GDP growth is estimated to have recovered to around 12% in 2018, while averaging -2.7% during 2015-18 on account of frequent droughts and a decline in mining production.  Reported inflation has been negative during 2016-18, following the exchange of currency in circulation in November 2015 that resulted in a monetary contraction. Deflation continued in 2018 as increased trade with Ethiopia resulted in further put downward pressure on prices.In recent years, Eritrea has significantly tightened fiscal policy to reverse the chronic deficits it suffered after the increase in regional insecurity in 1998. In 2018, the fiscal surplus widened to around 11% of GDP in 2018. This was largely achieved by a sharp drop in capital spending as well as some revenue measures. However, fiscal pressures, both recurrent and wage-related are likely to mount.Short-term growth prospects remain challenging given fiscal constraints and limited opportunities under existing restrictions. The recovery in agriculture is expected to slow. The country remains in a difficult macroeconomic situation with an unsustainable debt burden (including arrears to the World Bank) and vulnerable financial and external sectors.However, the economic outlook is potentially favorable in the medium term, reflecting the new mining operations coming on stream, but are also dependent on measures to relax restrictions on the private sector imposed and to reopen access to concessional development finance. Poverty appears to have remained widespread in Eritrea, but the lack of data limits available quantitative evidence. The most recent available survey data from 1996/97 indicate a 70% poverty rate.The country has seen consistent improvements in life expectancy (rising from 50 years in 1990 to 65 years in 2015) and expected years of schooling (from 3.8 years in 1995 to 5.4 years in 2010) and strong social outcomes in the face of limited resources.    Nevertheless, challenges remain. An unfinished maternal and child health agenda is compounded by a significant rise in Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs). Skilled birth attendance remains low, between 35-60%, maternal mortality ratio high at 485 deaths per 100,000 live births and under-five malnutrition also high with 52% of children underweight.Political BackgroundEritrea is small, coastal country strategically located along the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa, bordered by Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Eritrea is divided into six administrative regions called ‘zobas’, which vary in size, population and socioeconomic conditions. After a long liberation war, Eritrea regained self-rule in 1991 and full independence in 1993. The country enjoyed seven years of stabilization, reconstruction and development, before the onset of a border war with Ethiopia in 1998. The brunt of hostilities ended in 2000 and a UN Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) ruled in favor of Eritrea in 2002, but the border zone remained militarized, UN Security Council sanctions were imposed in 2009 and reinforced in 2011. Eritrea remained in a state of mobilization for almost two decades under transitional political arrangements focused on national security with a suspension of traditional checks and balances. The earlier development model was eschewed in favor of greater self-reliance and a more state-led planned economy.  Management of national resources – labor, land, and finance – was geared toward maintaining a state of military readiness, alongside efforts to broaden social equity. The private sector was gradually replaced by an extensive state sector geared to marshal scarce resources and increasing restrictions were imposed. An institutional framework developed to direct labor into an indefinite military and national service. The resulting austerity and extensive controls spurred migration of people and capital.In mid-2018, Eritrea experienced a turnaround in its external environment.   Ethiopia accepted the EEBC decision and signed a peace treaty with Eritrea in July 2018. Eritrea began to normalize relations with neighboring countries. In November 2018, UN Security Council lifted its sanctions on Eritrea. This raised expectations of a reorientation of Eritrean political and economic arrangements have been met with caution from the administration, as evidenced by President Isaias’ recent call for a “patient appraisal of the unfolding reality.”

        StrategyNumber of Active Projects15Lending$1.01 BillionIBRD$901.4 MillionIDA$50 MillionOther$58.95 MillionThe new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY19-22, developed in collaboration with the Government of Georgia and endorsed by the Board on May 22, 2018, aims to support sustainable and inclusive growth and improvements in living standards across three focus areas: (i) enhancing inclusive growth and competitiveness; (ii) investing in human capital; and (iii) building resilience. The CPF portfolio balances interventions to strengthen infrastructure and connectivity while aiming to grow the engagement on human capital. World Bank Group support includes investment financing and Advisory Services and Analytics.The current active lending portfolio includes 15 investment projects with a total commitment of US$1.01 billion, out of which US$401 million has been disbursed. Roughly 21 percent of the commitments is in sustainable development, 44 percent in infrastructure, 18 percent in human development, and 17 percent in equitable growth, finances, and institutions. In addition, the portfolio includes four recipient-executed trust fund operations of about US$16.7 million.In FY21, the Log-In Georgia Project (US$40 million, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD]) was approved by the Board. Three more IBRD lending operations (Georgia Relief and Recovery for MSMEs and Jobs; the Kakheti Integrated Mobility Project; and the Integrated Regional and Local Development Project), with total commitments estimated at US$300 million, are envisaged for FY21 and FY22 delivery.The knowledge program includes 13 activities totaling US$5.32 million in governance, macroeconomics, finance, innovations, energy and extractives, urban centers, the environment, and education.Key EngagementThe World Bank was one of the first international development institutions to extend support to Georgia in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank quickly mobilized teams to prepare three new operations totaling US$230 million IBRD. Approved on April 29, 2020, the Georgia Emergency COVID-19 Response Project of US$80 million, processed under the Bank’s Fast-Track COVID-19 Facility, aims at mitigating the health and social impacts of the pandemic.The World Bank has also collaborated with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to provide an additional US$100 million under a joint co-finance arrangement. With this support, the Ministry of Health of Georgia was able to procure vital medical equipment, including over 250,000 PCR tests and 350,000 Rapid Test Kits, effectively tripling Georgia’s testing capacity within the first months of the pandemic.The Supplemental Financing for the Economic Management and Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (US$50 million IBRD) is providing budget support to the Government amid a sharp decline in tax revenues and an unanticipated increase in expenditures to cover anti-crisis measures. The proposed Relief and Recovery for Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises Project (US$100 million IBRD) will support the jobs agenda, as well as micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, namely in hard-hit sectors such as tourism and agriculture.The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the critical importance of digital technologies and connectivity, which is why the World Bank has rolled out the Log-In Georgia Project in support of Georgia’s National Broadband Development Strategy for 2020–25. The US$40 million project, approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on August 28, 2020, will connect nearly 500,000 people residing in up to 1,000 villages in mountainous and remote regions to high-speed affordable broadband internet. The project will also promote digital financial services, e-commerce, and e-government services, as well as remote learning and telemedicine, all of which have proven to be invaluable in the wake of the pandemic.Support for the fight against COVID-19 is also being delivered through the US$102.7 million Innovation, Inclusion and Quality Project (I2Q), launched in March 2020, which is aimed at bolstering Georgia’s human capital development through improving access to and the quality of early childhood education and care. As a response to the pandemic, the I2Q project’s resources are to support the Government’s efforts to promote distance education and reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 on student learning, particularly for the vulnerable, during the school closures. Overall, the project is expected to benefit around 116,000 preschool and general education students and ultimately narrow the skills gap between their learning outcomes and labor market expectations.The World Bank has also played a key role in leveraging partnerships with other international financial institutions (IFIs), such as AIIB, KfW (the German Development Bank), and the International Monetary Fund, to maximize finance for Georgia’s pandemic response.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsGeorgia was initially successful in containing the spread of COVID-19, supported by timely and stringent measures that included border closures and lockdowns early on in the crisis. However, the initial economic shock was severe, with the economy contracting by 16.6 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in April. With infections under control, restrictions were gradually loosened and the economy started to recover, with the GDP contraction narrowing to 5.3 percent y-o-y by August 2020. More than one-third of employed people were unable to work at the height of the restrictions, and more than 8 percent of jobs were lost in the second quarter while wages fell by 11 percent y-o-y in real terms.The current account deficit deteriorated to 11 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2020, almost doubling over the previous year, in response to a sharp drop in tourism and remittances. The deficit has narrowed more recently, reflecting a sharper contraction in imports compared to exports and a better-than-expected performance of transfers from abroad. On the financing side, net FDI and portfolio inflows underperformed compared to 2019.The exchange rate overshot in March 2020 as the pandemic spread, and together with supply chain disruptions, pushed inflation up to 6.9 percent in April 2020, well above the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) target of 3 percent. The recovery of the GEL as well as a year-on-year decline in global oil prices helped to bring inflation down to 4.8 percent in August. In response, the NBG has gradually lowered its policy rate by 100 basis points since April 2020 to 8 percent. However, the GEL has come under pressure more recently; if sustained, this could reignite inflationary expectations.The fiscal response has generally been adequate but has resulted in an increased fiscal deficit, with rising social spending and a decline in revenue collections. The fiscal stimulus package, estimated at 5.5 percent of GDP, is expected to push the deficit to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2020. Public debt, as of end-July, was up by 29 percent y-o-y to 50 percent of GDP. COVID-19-related support from IFIs will fully cover the fiscal needs in 2020. Economic Outlook The economy is projected to contract by 6 percent in 2020, with severe welfare impacts and projected poverty increases of up to 2.8 percentage points (using the US$3.20 PPP 2011 international poverty line). This translates into 160,000 Georgians becoming impoverished. In addition, over 400,000 could suffer downward mobility.The fiscal deficit is set to widen sharply in 2020 but is projected to gradually decline to levels prescribed by the fiscal rule (3 percent of GDP) by 2020, as tax deferrals expire and some of the support measures are scaled back. The external gap will widen in 2020, as suspended tourist arrivals and lower exports and remittances are only partially offset by shrinking imports. Robust support from IFIs is expected to ensure that the deficit is fully financed and foreign exchange reserves remain at comfortable levels.The pace of recovery beyond 2020 is contingent upon the duration of the pandemic, the availability and distribution of a vaccine, and the restoration of international trade and investment flows. A baseline scenario in which a second wave of infections does not materialize would see gradual economic recovery, with growth recovering to 4 percent in 2021 and 6 percent in 2022. Even so, real GDP under this scenario would be around 10 percent lower in 2022 than projected before the pandemic.The key risk to the outlook is a more prolonged and severe COVID-19 outbreak that could lead to further restrictions. The rate of the spread of infections has accelerated, albeit from a low base, and in early September some restrictions were re-introduced, such as on large gatherings. If extended, this could imply that output may return to 2019 levels only in 2023. Furthermore, the unresolved territorial conflicts in the South Caucasus, including the recent flare-up of tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia, weigh on investment prospects in Georgia, as perceptions of political risks (already quite elevated in Georgia1) increase.--------------------------------[1] On the Economist Intelligence Unit Risk tracker, Georgia’s overall risk score is 39 (on a scale of 0–100, with 100 being most risky), while the score for the political risk component is 50.

        Guatemala has experienced economic stability due to a combination of prudent fiscal management, inflation targeting, and a managed floating exchange rate. The Guatemalan economy -the largest in Central America- has also had a solid performance, although with moderate growth rates of 3.5 % on average in the last five years.This economic stability, however, has not translated to a significant reduction in poverty and inequality. Measured by its GDP per capita (US$ 4,549 in 2018), Guatemala is the fifth poorest economy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), with persistently high rates of poverty and inequality.Guatemala also has the sixth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in LAC. Chronic childhood malnutrition (and stunting) affects 47 % of all children under the age of five, 58 % of indigenous children, and 66 % of children in the lowest income quintile. In 2019, Guatemala ranked 68th in food security out of 113 countries, with only 40 % of Guatemalan families enjoying food security.Low central government revenues (11 % of GDP on average in recent years and an estimated 9.7 % in 2019) limit capacities for public investments and restrict both the quality and coverage of basic public services, from education and health to access to water. This, in turn, perpetuates a lack of incentive in the economy for formality and tax paying.Disrupting billions of lives and livelihoods in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens decades of hard-won development gains. In a more moderate scenario, the global economy could shrink by 5.2 % in 2020 before rebounding in 2021; in a more negative scenario of prolonged shutdowns, world output could contract by almost 8 % in 2020.The pandemic has affected the Guatemalan economy considerably —it is expected to contract by 3 % in 2020—, leading to substantial adverse social effects and worsened existing vulnerabilities.Firms, particularly MSMEs, providing more than 90 % of private jobs, have been affected significantly due to lockdown measures, falling demand, bottlenecks in supply chains and drying liquidity as revenues collapse.Jobs losses are expected to be highest in construction, services, transport and commerce, where most of the vulnerable workforce is concentrated, and where female employment is also most prominent.The incomes of the self-employed (around 40 % of the labor force), temporary workers and workers in affected sectors (e.g., tourism and entertainment) will slump.The recession in the U.S. could affect exports and remittance inflows, the largest two sources of foreign exchange earnings, and exacerbate the private consumption slowdown.Approximately one million people are expected to fall into poverty, raising the country’s poverty rate by as much as 6 percentage points, depending on the depth and duration of the crisis as well as the speed of the economic recovery.Additionally, Guatemala is extremely affected by climate and weather events and its poorer populations are particularly vulnerable. Guatemala ranks ninth in the world for level of risk to the effects of climate change.

        Since COVID-19 struck, the World Bank has been working intensely on fast, broad actions to limit the harm and help countries, including Guatemala, prepare for recovery and rebuilding better and stronger than before, by focusing on four priorities:    i) saving lives threatened by the pandemic;    ii) protecting the poor and vulnerable;    iii) securing the foundations of the economy to shorten the time to       recovery; and    iv) strengthening policies and institutions for resilience based on transparent and sustainable debt and investments.The World Bank's active portfolio in Guatemala amounts to US$ 320 million, and includes US$ 200 million in budget support in case of emergencies (disbursed to support the response against the COVID-19 pandemic), a US$ 20 million health investment project to support the pandemic response and the US$ 100 million Crecer Sano project, focused on reducing chronic child malnutrition. The World Bank is also discussing possible additional financial support with Guatemalan authorities to protect vulnerable populations, mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic and support economic reactivation, and a possible investment project to support productivity in the agricultural sector.The World Bank's current work program in Guatemala also includes technical assistance initiatives to strengthen the financial development of micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs), the Government’s human resources management systems, and safety net delivery systems, among others. It also includes initiatives aimed at increasing statistical development capacities in the education sector, modernizing the country’s financial sector and increasing market access for women farmers.The World Bank plans to update in 2021the Systematic Country Diagnostic, a comprehensive assessment of Guatemala's growth and inclusion challenges for the coming years. This analysis will also serve as a reference to adapt the World Bank's work program and support Guatemala in promoting reforms towards its long-term development vision.

        Technical support provided by the World Bank and UNICEF to the Ministry of Social Development, for designing a comprehensive information management system and strengthening its social protection systems, allowed the Government of Guatemala to rapidly expand its cash transfers program in 2020 and create the “Bono Familia” to support families during the COVID-19 pandemic. The “Bono Familia” platform enables beneficiary families (around 2 million) to be identified through a simplified verification process, minimizing personal contact, and the delivery of 1,000 quetzales (US$ 134) per family through “simplified bank accounts”. Money can be received in bank branches or ATMs or used to pay for goods in stores, allowing the expansion of digital payments for thousands of families who lacked access to bank accounts.The Project to Support a Rural Economic Development Program improved the competitiveness of rural value chains and strengthened the institutional capacity of public entities through the adoption of a land management model. Results of this project include support for more than 200 partnerships with a high participation from indigenous groups; an increase of US$ 16.4 million in these associations’ total sales; rehabilitation and construction of bridges to benefit 160,000 people, and support for the development of 324 municipal development plans.The Second Land Administration Project helped improve land tenure security for close to one million people (51 % of which are women) and resolve land conflicts. More than 1,600 indigenous families received titles and four communities benefited from communal land certification, a historic precedent set by the Project. The cadastral information generated is now being used by 22 municipalities for multiple purposes, including territorial planning activities.The Maternal-Infant Health and Nutrition Project helped to provide access to basic health and nutrition services for over one million people through the building or renovation of 35 health centers for maternal and child care, training of more than 5,000 health workers and support to the Comprehensive Community Care program for Children and Women (AINM-C) in 142 jurisdictions, among other activities. The maternal mortality rate declined by more than 50 percent between 2006 and 2012 in the intervention areas, while the percentage of pregnant women who received prenatal care increased from 54 % in 2006 to 89 % in 2012.Through the Project to Strengthen the Resilience of the Maya and Rural Residents Facing Food Insecurity and Climate Change in Guatemala’s Dry Corridor, the World Bank helped the population cope with climate change through ecologically-sensitive, lower-cost production systems, which increased productivity levels and contributed to food security. Project beneficiaries included 1,600 families living in the departments of Baja Verapaz, El Progreso and Jalapa.The study Towards Better Expenditure Quality: Guatemala Public Expenditure Review analyzed the quality of the country’s public expenditures in education, health, citizen security and other sectors. The study found that targeting of social spending could be improved given that public education and health expenditures do not benefit regions with the greatest need. The study also identified a need to boost resources to improve citizen security, especially for preventive programs, police forces, penitentiary and rehabilitation systems and for strengthening capabilities of the public prosecutor’s office.World Bank support through the Competitiveness Project was instrumental in strengthening the National Competitiveness Program (PRONACOM) and the operational startup of the INVEST in Guatemala Agency, which succeeded in facilitating US$ 944 million in new foreign direct investments, resulting in the creation of 73 new firms and 24,000 new jobs between 2005 and 2008.

        Lesotho is a small, mountainous, and landlocked country, surrounded by its much larger neighbor, South Africa. It has a population of about two million, and nominal per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $1,299.Lesotho is classified as a lower-middle-income country. It is mostly highlands, with its lowest point 1,400 meters above sea level. Previously a British protectorate, the nation gained its independence in October 4, 1966. A constitutional monarchy, Lesotho is ruled by a king as Head of State, and the Prime Minister as Head of Government, governed by a 33-member Senate and a 120-member National Assembly. Elections were held in June 2017 for the third time in five years, leading to the formation of a four-party coalition government, led by Prime Minister Thomas Thabane.In keeping with recommendations made by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the government is currently undertaking key constitutional, security, parliamentary, judicial, public sector, economic and media sector reforms.  Economic growthIn recent years, Lesotho’s economic performance has been negatively affected by sluggish global economic growth amid a major downturn in both emerging markets and advanced economies. Furthermore, sustained political instability in the country, coupled with slow economic growth in the South African economy, also contributed to slow economic performance. Real GDP growth rate is estimated to have averaged 1.6% between 2015–2019 and it is projected to average 0.6% between 2019–2021, largely attributed to the expected negative impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus). In the medium-term, economic growth is expected to be boosted by construction-related projects including construction works associated with the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP II), the Lesotho Lowlands Water Development Projects (LLWDP -I and-II), and government roads. The water and electricity subsectors are expected to be boosted by green energy projects, while the tertiary sector is envisaged to be supported inter alia by government initiatives to reinforce financial inclusion.Unemployment remains high at 23.6% in 2018 coupled with high inequality and poverty. The national poverty rate declined from 56.6% in 2002 to 49.7% in 2017. Urban areas registered strong poverty reduction of 13 percentage points, while rural areas poverty rates levels decreased marginally by 0.6 percentage points, leading to wider urban-rural inequality.Over the same period, extreme poverty declined from 34.1 to 24.1% while the poverty gap declined from 29.0% to 21.9% leading to a lower Gini coefficient, hence the narrowing in the income inequality in the country. As such, Lesotho is more equal than its neighbors, with a Gini coefficient of 44.6. However, it remains one of the 20% most unequal countries in the world.Development Challenges and RisksCOVID–19 poses some challenges to global health systems as well as social and economic prospects at large. This has spillover effects onto Lesotho by way of slower economic activities and risks to vulnerable people.Lesotho’s economy is significantly open to global trade.COVID-19 is expected to impact supply chains, thus hampering trade, as most textiles and apparel firms in Lesotho source raw materials from China, which is the epicenter of the COVID-19. Furthermore, commodity exports to major economies such as Euro Area and the United States are most likely to be negatively affected. The tourism sector is also expected to be negatively affected by the advent of COVID-19.High HIV/AIDS prevalence and tuberculosis remain Lesotho’s greatest health challenge. The HIV prevalence rate in Lesotho is 25% percent in the adult population (15-49 years), the second highest in the world. The incidence of TB stands at 611 cases per 100,000, according to the World Health Organization’s Global TB report 2019. While high health costs exert more pressure to the fiscal burden, high HIV/AIDS and TB rates continue to contribute to persistently high inequality and poverty.

        Health SectorThe Health Sector Performance Enhancement Project (HSPEP) has closed and is transitioning towards a Nutrition and Health System Strengthening Project. Building on the success of the quality improvement program piloted under the HSPEP, the new project will implement a quality reward system and a multisectoral package of nutrition specific and sensitive interventions.Lesotho’s overall progress since the Southern Africa Tuberculosis Health System Strengthening Project was launched in December 2016 is satisfactory. Overall performance include notable achievements: (i) a four-fold increase in the number of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases over the past three years, which is a marker of quality improvement; (ii) the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL) successfully upgraded to bio-safety level three standards and human resource capacity for the laboratory management strengthened; related to this, the NTRL and Mafeteng and Motebang labs have progressed towards accreditation to three stars and above; (iii) intensified roll-out of community-level TB case finding, which led to a 63% increase in the number of presumptive clients analyzed by Gene Xpert and an increase of 214% of TB cases detected between project baseline and the midterm review.Social Protection The Social Assistance Project aims to support the government  to improve the efficiency, equity and shock-responsive function of selected social assistance programs and, in the event of an Eligible Crisis or Emergency, to provide immediate and effective response to said Eligible Crisis or Emergency. In partnership with UNICEF and the European Union, the government has been able to (i) successfully merge the Post Primary Bursary Program (PPB) and the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Program into one, saving important administrative costs; (ii) expand coverage of the Child Grant Program (CGP) from 27,000 households to approximately 42,000 households, (iii) increase coverage of the National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA) to all Community Councils in the country: (iv) deactivate more than 12,000 names of deceased beneficiaries from the Old Age Pension (OAP) database, saving the equivalent of $7 million; (v) support the automation of data cross-match between the Civil Service Pension and the OAP to identify and remove double dippers; (vi) pilot a proof of life process whereby approximately 5,000 OAP pensioners and their proxies without national identification were provided with one; (vii) support the creation of the Department of Social Assistance, within which all managerial positions have been filled.The project has also financed emergency top-ups to CGP recipients in the amount of $1.9 million. A total of 27,000 beneficiaries received CGP top-up payments for two consecutive quarters, to help them mitigate the negative effects of the 2015/16 El Nino drought.

Furthermore, sustained political instability in the country, coupled with slow economic growth in the South African economy, also contributed to slow economic performance. Real GDP growth rate is estimated to have averaged 1.6% between 2015–2019 and it is projected to average 0.6% between 2019–2021, largely attributed to the expected negative impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus). In the medium-term, economic growth is expected to be boosted by construction-related projects including construction works associated with the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP II), the Lesotho Lowlands Water Development Projects (LLWDP -I and-II), and government roads. The water and electricity subsectors are expected to be boosted by green energy projects, while the tertiary sector is envisaged to be supported inter alia by government initiatives to reinforce financial inclusion.Unemployment remains high at 23.6% in 2018 coupled with high inequality and poverty. The national poverty rate declined from 56.6% in 2002 to 49.7% in 2017. Urban areas registered strong poverty reduction of 13 percentage points, while rural areas poverty rates levels decreased marginally by 0.6 percentage points, leading to wider urban-rural inequality.Over the same period, extreme poverty declined from 34.1 to 24.1% while the poverty gap declined from 29.0% to 21.9% leading to a lower Gini coefficient, hence the narrowing in the income inequality in the country. As such, Lesotho is more equal than its neighbors, with a Gini coefficient of 44.6. However, it remains one of the 20% most unequal countries in the world.Development Challenges and RisksCOVID–19 poses some challenges to global health systems as well as social and economic prospects at large. This has spillover effects onto Lesotho by way of slower economic activities and risks to vulnerable people.Lesotho’s economy is significantly open to global trade.COVID-19 is expected to impact supply chains, thus hampering trade, as most textiles and apparel firms in Lesotho source raw materials from China, which is the epicenter of the COVID-19. Furthermore, commodity exports to major economies such as Euro Area and the United States are most likely to be negatively affected. The tourism sector is also expected to be negatively affected by the advent of COVID-19.High HIV/AIDS prevalence and tuberculosis remain Lesotho’s greatest health challenge. The HIV prevalence rate in Lesotho is 25% percent in the adult population (15-49 years), the second highest in the world. The incidence of TB stands at 611 cases per 100,000, according to the World Health Organization’s Global TB report 2019. While high health costs exert more pressure to the fiscal burden, high HIV/AIDS and TB rates continue to contribute to persistently high inequality and poverty.

        Partners in Lesotho include members of the diplomatic corps, consular missions, and international organizations. Presently, there are five Embassies/High Commissions and nine international organizations, of which seven are from the UN family, and the other two are the Delegation of the European Union and the World Bank. Development Cooperation is coordinated by the Ministry of Development Planning.

        Located off the southeast coast of Africa, neighboring the French island of La Reunion, Mauritius is an island state of about 1.3 million people. The country’s economy has made great strides since independence in 1968, and is now classified as a high-income country. Key challenges include managing the transition to a knowledge-based economy and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Political Context Mauritius is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Shifting coalitions are a feature of politics in the country. The President is the head of state, while the Prime Minister has full executive powers and heads the government. General elections were held November 7, 2019. The result was a victory for the Mauritian Alliance (a coalition of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), Muvman Liberater, Alan Ganoo Movement and Plateforme Militante), which won 42 of the 70 seats. Pravind Jugnauth of the MSM remained Prime Minister. Recent Economic Developments The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 grew 3.6%, driven by construction and services sectors (banking, ICT) as well as a rebound in agriculture. Manufacturing growth remained on a sluggish trend and was negatively impacted by decelerating global demand during 2019. This continued a pattern of structural transformation, with more knowledge intensive services sectors expanding while some of the sectors that have traditionally provided low-skilled employment stagnating or contracting. Based on its 2019 data, Mauritius was classified as a high-income country by the World Bank for the first time in July 2020.  The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is severely affecting the country’s economy through a standstill in tourist arrivals, crumbling export demand in particular for its garment sector, and the temporary lockdown measures adopted in April, May and June. While the spread of COVID-19 in the country was effectively stopped in April with no new domestic cases as of July 2020, GDP is expected to contract in double digits. The government put in place a support package to help the private sector cope with the shock, which mitigated the impact on employment, while in combination with declining revenue leading to a large deficit for the fiscal year 2019/20. Development Challenges Mauritius faces the challenge of managing its transition to a knowledge-based economy, driven by innovation and productivity growth. This will require a concerted effort to remove bottlenecks to new sources of growth and private investment, such as a lack of connectivity, skills shortages, and misaligned incentives that will also be critical for its recovery from the COVID-19 induced recession. While the trend may have recently been reversed, inequality has been on the rise for a number of years. Public transfers have contributed to mitigate the rise in total income inequality. While general unemployment was low pre-COVID-19 (6.9% in Q1 2020), women face a higher unemployment rate at 9.8%, and a much lower labor force participation rate.  Mauritius is highly vulnerable to tropical storms and the risk is amplified by climate change. A multi-hazard risk assessment completed in 2017 suggests that Mauritius experiences on average $110 million per year in direct losses from tropical cyclones and floods. Each year, there is a 1% chance of losses exceeding $1.9 billion, or 16% of Mauritius’ GDP. Mauritius lies within the cyclone area of the Indian Ocean. A large share of the population and productive assets in Mauritius are exposed to multiple risks from cyclones. Flood risk is continuously increasing. The frequency of storms of tropical cyclone strength (winds above 165 km/h) has increased significantly over the past three decades.

        World Bank Group Engagement in Mauritius The World Bank Group’s (WBG) role in Mauritius is evolving, reflecting the country's success in gaining access to capital markets. Because of its high-income status, Mauritius is one of only a few African countries eligible for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) assistance. While there is currently no active World Bank financing operation in Mauritius, demand for knowledge support is on the rise.  The WBG strategy of engagement with Mauritius, known as the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the Fiscal years 2017–21, seeks to assist Mauritius to address its national priorities with a focus on promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.

        Most of the World Bank’s support to Mauritius is provided through knowledge activities, including technical assistance funded through Reimbursable Advisory Services. Currently, the World Bank is supporting the implementation of the government’s basic education reform (Nine-Year Schooling) strengthening banking supervision, Doing Business reform, planning, an assessment of productivity trends, and reform options for the sugar sector. Recent knowledge products cover the sustainable development of Mauritius’ Ocean Economy, and on the drivers of inequality, labor market mobility, and the distributive effects of the fiscal and transfer system.  A Country Economic Memorandum focused on the priorities for a successful recovery from the COVID-19 shock is currently being prepared.

A large share of the population and productive assets in Mauritius are exposed to multiple risks from cyclones. Flood risk is continuously increasing. The frequency of storms of tropical cyclone strength (winds above 165 km/h) has increased significantly over the past three decades.

        Myanmar is a nation in transition, seeking to break with a past marred by authoritarian rule, economic mismanagement, and multiple conflicts that persist today, driven by social exclusion and predatory natural resource extraction. The country’s opening, in 2011, and the first democratic elections, in 2015, marked critical turning points for Myanmar, generating a wave of optimism. Unification of exchange rates, initial liberalization of product and factor markets, integration into regional markets, and modernization of economic and financial institutions and systems resulted in rapid economic growth (above 7 percent per year) and measurable improvements in social welfare since 2011. Poverty almost halved, falling from 48 percent to 25 percent between 2005 and 2017.Reform momentum slowed after 2016 as a newly elected civilian government grappled with defining its economic vision and managing the public administration to implement policies and programs. Most recently, the Government adopted an ambitious Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan, reinvigorated its economic reform agenda, and has gradually begun to tackle the more difficult second-generation reforms needed to sustain the economic transition. The second democratic national elections are scheduled for November 2020.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic growth in Myanmar was projected to pick up to 6.3 percent in FY2019/20 and 6.4 percent in FY2020/21. However, Myanmar’s economy is now expected to decline sharply due to direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. The global shock and domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus have had a substantial economic cost. And, initially numbers of known COVID-19 positive cases were relatively low but see since mid-August 2020 a sharp rise.Economic growth in a baseline scenario is projected to drop from 6.8 percent in FY18/19 to just 0.5 percent in FY2019/20. If the pandemic is protracted, the economy could contract by as much as 2.5 percent in FY2019/20, with the expected recovery in 2020/21 subject to further downside risks.The slowing economic growth threatens to partially reverse Myanmar’s recent progress in poverty reduction while reducing the incomes of households that are already poor.Under the baseline scenario, in which the domestic spread of the coronavirus is brought under control, the global economy swiftly recovers, and Myanmar’s GDP growth rate is projected to bounce back to 7.2 percent in FY2020/21, poverty rates would increase in the short term and will not return to pre-crisis levels FY2021/22. Under the downside scenario, poverty rates would remain above their pre-crisis level until at least FY2022/23.As in other countries, exclusion in Myanmar occurs along many lines including gender, ethnicity, and citizenship. This—coupled with widespread underdevelopment and weak service delivery—means that human capital is particularly limited in Myanmar. Unless Myanmar invests in all its people it will not be able to maximize economic growth, undermining prosperity not just for the excluded, but for everybody. There is a two-way association: broadly shared economic opportunities are needed to reinforce durable peace, but progress is needed for peace and civil liberties to offer economic opportunities to all and maximize growth and shared prosperity in Myanmar.The crisis in Rakhine State, together with intensified conflict in other states, poses a serious threat to Myanmar’s goal of becoming ‘a peaceful and prosperous’ nation.  Since the tragic events of 2017, the World Bank Group (WBG) has engaged in a profound reflection on how best to respond to Myanmar’s recurring conflict and violence.  This has involved analysis of the drivers of exclusion and conflict and on social inclusion within the WBG program.  On this basis, the WBG adjusted its strategy, redesigned its planned pipeline and introduced new operations focused specifically on social inclusion in conflict areas.Climate change is another major challenge for the development of Myanmar.

        The World Bank Group seeks to support Myanmar through a challenging transition to achieve progress in the twin goals of reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity. We aim to help Myanmar advance its economic transition sustainably, while ensuring that the benefits of the transition are shared more widely. Our support is centered around the cross-cutting theme of promoting social inclusion for all people, including in conflict-affected areas.Under the new Myanmar Country Partnership Framework (FY2020-2023), the focus areas of WBG engagement are a) building human capital and fostering peaceful communities; b) fostering responsible private sector-led growth and inclusive economic opportunities; and c) enhancing climate and disaster resilience and sustainable natural resource and environmental management.To build human capital and foster peaceful communities the World Bank Group:targets its investments at the community level to make sure that underserved communities receive critical infrastructure and services, including basic services of health, education and nutrition, including in conflict areas.helps institutions, from the village to the national level, to coordinate better and respond more effectively and inclusively to the needs of everyone, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.supports building human capital in conflict affected areas through education, health, and nutrition interventions that facilitate cooperation between Ethnic Service Providers (ESPs), civil society organizations, and authorities of the self-administered areas and state governments.To foster responsible private sector-led growth and inclusive economic opportunities the World Bank Group:is committed to helping Myanmar to manage the economy and financial sector, and to develop a private sector applying regulations uniformly and without discrimination, with open and competitive tendering processes -- to ensure a more prosperous, equitable future for all the people of Myanmar.prioritizes bringing tangible income generation and employment opportunities to the poor with a focus on developing Myanmar’s largest employment sectors, agriculture and tourism.To enhance climate and disaster resilience and sustainable natural resource and environmental management the World Bank Group:supports building the resilience of Myanmar to cope with natural disasters while ensuring that natural resources and the environment are managed sustainably for the benefit of existing and future generations.The Myanmar Partnership Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established in 2014 and  represents a collaboration between the Government of Myanmar; Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT); UK Government Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID); the Kingdom of Denmark; the Republic of Finland; and the World Bank Group represented by the International Finance Cooperation and the World Bank (IBRD/IDA). The Myanmar Partnership MDTF seeks to implement Myanmar’s Sustainable Development Plan through enhanced coordination, World Bank Group technical assistance and government executed projects. The Myanmar Partnership’s MDTF program activities align with and compliment the World Bank Group’s major focus areas for Myanmar.

Since 2013, the NCDDP Project has benefitted more than seven million people in 63 townships (20% of the country) and more than 12,000 villages, through the financing of approximately 30,000 sub-projects that improve basic infrastructure and services for transport (roads, bridges, jetties), water, schools, electrification, etc. The NCDDP invested heavily in capacity building and facilitation support for community members who would take direct responsibility for identifying priority development needs and implementing solutions. In the first two years, the project did not operate in conflict areas, but now more than one-third of project areas are considered conflict-affected.Building on the successful NCDDP, the Government of Myanmar requested the activation of the project’s Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) in May 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The CERC was successfully activated on July 10, 2020. To date, by reallocating US$110 million to support cash-for-work (CfW) and revolving loan fund (EVRF) activities, the Government has transferred wages worth $10 million to 390,000 beneficiaries (42% female) through the CfW scheme and disbursed almost $30 million in loans to 135,000 households through the EVRF. The Government of Myanmar adopted the National Electrification Plan in 2014 – drawing from World Bank analytical support and expertise through the National Electrification Project (NEP) – to achieve universal access to sustainable electricity services by 2030. One third of the population without electricity access belong to over 130 distinct groups, have distinct languages/dialects, are often among the poorest, and reside in the most isolated regions, which compounds the challenges of service delivery. Since its implementation, NEP has successfully provided access to electricity to 2.2 million people, half of whom female beneficiaries, in 10,000 villages in remote rural areas through 381,000 solar home systems. In addition, the project has provided electricity access to all 15,000 schools, rural health clinics and community centers in villages. 70,000 solar streetlights have been installed and been providing safety to the residents. As part of implementation support, the project helped the government in the procurement system that resulted cost efficiency and value for money through US$50 million savings on the budget using international competitive procurement. Also, a mobile phone-based Citizen Engagement Platform has successfully established in the pilot phase and being scaled up parallel to increase of solar home system installations.The Decentralizing Funding to Schools Project  (DFSP) has disbursed funds to township education offices, schools, and at-risk children and their families, in which 244,331 students in 57 townships have received stipends to date, all government schools (47,008) and monastic schools (1,500) in 330 townships receive school improvement funding, more than 20,000 mentee-teachers in 150 townships benefitted from in-school visit and support from a teacher mentor, six rounds of early learning assessment data were collected, analyzed, and used to inform to design an early reading pilot. The project upholds two underlying principles, which are non-discrimination and inclusive consultation.The Inclusive Access and Quality Education (IAQE) project builds on and extends the geographic scope of the ongoing DFSP and takes a national and a focused approach, covering all states and regions and supporting programs to reach out to schools across the country, while placing greater emphasis on social inclusion and support to conflict-affected areas. More than 70 percent of the financing will be channeled to Myanmar’s most disadvantaged townships, with a particular focus on the most under-performing schools and teachers within these townships. The IAQE project will also support strengthening the efficiency of the education system, including through improved public financial and human resource management and technical support to the Ministry of Education, and will closely monitor implementation across the country.Since 2015, the Myanmar Essential Health Services Access Project (EHSAP) has been supporting over 12,000 primary health care facilities across the country, ranging from township hospitals to the sub rural health centers, with monthly health facility funds to improve service delivery readiness of these critical frontline health facilities, thus expanding access to basic essential health services for mothers, newborns and children both at the facility level and within the community. In addition, EHSAP strengthens the quality of care by skills building of frontline health workers – about 9,000 midwives were trained on how to provide emergency care during pregnancy and immediately after birth for mothers and babies, and 4,500 midwives learnt also how to identify and manage common childhood illnesses. At the systems level, EHSAP enhances supervision practice by improving the regularity and systematic approach of the supervision visits, improves efficiency and responsiveness of public finance through financial trainings and financial data system modernization, and supports introduction of tablets-based health management information system to the midwives.Funds under EHSAP have also been mobilized to assist Myanmar’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic by financing (i) capacity building  and operational costs to intensify surveillance activities in all states and regions; (i) establishment of functioning information and reporting system for all suspected cases; (iii) engagement with basic health staff (BHS) including Ethnic Health Organizations for community surveillance; (iv) dissemination of guidelines to BHS and community volunteers on COVID-19; (v) development and dissemination of Information, Education and Communication materials for risk communication on COVID-19; and (vi) operating expenses at the point of entries.In April 2020, the World Bank approved a US$50 million loan for the Myanmar COVID-19 Emergency Response Project to help Myanmar fill a critical gap in its contingency plan to urgently increase hospital preparedness and surge capacity in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, protect health workers, and treat patients. Eleven central level hospitals and 50 Region and State level hospitals across all Regions and States have been prioritized for project support. The Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) is collaborating with UNOPS to procure the critical goods and supplies for the intensive care units (ICU) in the prioritized 61 hospitals. The project is also supporting MOHS efforts to enhance risk communication and community engagement activities and training of health workers on quality and safety of clinical services.Much needed financial support in these difficult times for people in Myanmar is also provided under the Maternal and Child Cash Transfer Project. Over 126,600 women (pregnant women and women with children under two years old) in Ayeyarwady Region and Shan State were enrolled in the program by late August 2020.  The beneficiaries have now received 6 months of cash payment, totaling MMK 90,000 (15,000MMK/$US11.50 per month). Cash distribution began on September 9, 2020 through private payment agents, namely AYA and KBZ banks.  To date, 50% of beneficiaries in Shan State and 70% in Ayeyarwady Region have received payments.  Cash is being transferred through E-wallet or through the nearest AYA Pay or KBZ Pay agents.  The next round of cash distribution will be in January 2021. Supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobsReducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity will entail diversification beyond extractive-based industries. Increased openness and integration will result in higher growth, as labor reallocates to more productive sectors and trade drives innovation and productivity. The World Bank Group is helping to foster inclusive growth and a vibrant private sector that will create jobs through investments and support for markets, trade and modern financial institutions.IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development organization working with the private sector in developing countries. Since 2013, IFC has invested and mobilized over US$1.4 billion in Myanmar to help create jobs. A strong private sector is vital to ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. That’s why IFC is focused on unlocking private investment, creating markets and opportunities where they are needed most. In Myanmar, IFC is focused on helping the country meet its critical needs for infrastructure, especially power, telecoms and transport; agribusiness, and financial services, including support for the microfinance sector. IFC’s work has for example helped more than 600,000 gain access to microfinance with more than 80 percent of those women. IFC’s Lighting Myanmar program, launched in 2016, has reached almost 80,000 households, some in the country’s most remote off grid areas.  Our advisory services are also aimed at helping encouraging reforms to improve the business environment as well as raising corporate governance and environmental and social performance standards, and helping banks develop new products for small and medium sized enterprises. Our work has also focused on helping to create respectful workplaces and tackling childcare.The World Bank Group is also contributing to informed debate and decision-making on development policy within a rapidly changing Myanmar by bringing the most recent data and analysis on development issues to policy makers, think tanks, civil society, and citizens.Analytical and diagnostic work covers a wide range of development areas, including the Myanmar Country Environmental Analysis, which is a comprehensive analysis on the country’s environment and natural resources challenges and identifies strategic recommendations; the Subnational Public Expenditure Review 2019, which examines Myanmar’s nascent subnational institutions, focusing on governance, union-local administrative and fiscal relations and service delivery from a local perspective; and, Multidimensional Welfare in Myanmar, which aims to formulate a multidimensional view on how deprived the people in Myanmar are, understand the intensity and determinants of multidimensional disadvantages, and provide a view of multidimensional disadvantage at the sub-national level, pointing to relative disadvantage of each Township in Myanmar; and, the Systematic Country Diagnostic, which identified prioritized policy areas and actions for progress in Myanmar in preparation of the new Country Partnership Framework (2019-2023).To mitigate longer-term economic effects, Myanmar will benefit from developing keener understandings of the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 on its firms and households. Partnering with the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), the World Bank has established the Myanmar COVID-19 Monitoring Platform to provide accurate and timely economic data to inform and provide key insights to the Government of Myanmar, development partners and wider civil society. The Platform is based on high-frequency phone surveys with firm and household respondents and a community assessment, in addition to existing analytical products such as the World Bank Myanmar Economic Monitor, which twice a year examines economic developments and reforms.

        Pakistan’s real GDP growth is estimated to have declined from 1.9 percent in FY19 to -1.5 percent in FY20. The first contraction in decades, this reflects the effects of COVID-19 containment measures that followed monetary and fiscal tightening prior to the outbreak. To curtail the spread of the pandemic, a partial lockdown – that included restrictions on air travel, inner-city public transport, religious/social gatherings and the closure of all schools and non-essential businesses – was imposed in March, and gradually eased from May 2020 onwards. This disrupted domestic supply and demand, as businesses were unable to operate and consumers curbed expenditures, which specifically affected services and industries. The services sector is estimated to have contracted, by over 1 percent, while industrial production is expected to have declined even more, due to the high policy rates prior to the pandemic and plunging domestic and global demand thereafter. The agriculture sector, partially insulated from the effects of the containment measures, is estimated to have expanded modestly over the year.On the demand side, private consumption is estimated to have contracted in FY20, as households reduced consumption amid the lockdown and dimmer employment prospects. Similarly, with heightened uncertainty, disrupted supply chains and a global slowdown, investment is estimated to have fallen drastically. Exports and imports also shrank given weaknesses in global trade and domestic demand. In contrast, government consumption growth rose, reflecting the rollout of the fiscal stimulus package to cushion the effects of the pandemic.Despite weak activity, consumer price inflation rose from an average of 6.8 percent in FY19 to an average of 10.7 percent in FY20, due to surging food inflation, hikes in administered energy prices, and a weaker rupee, which depreciated 13.8 percent against the U.S. dollar in FY20. With elevated inflationary pressures, the policy rate was held at 13.25 percent from July to February but was subsequently lowered to 7.0 percent over the remainder of FY20 to support dwindling activity and as inflationary expectations fell amid the pandemic. The central bank also implemented multiple measures to provide liquidity support to firms. At end-FY20, the banking system remained well capitalized, though upticks in non-performing loans were beginning to erode capital buffers.The current account deficit shrunk from 4.8 percent of GDP in FY19 to 1.1 percent of GDP in FY20, the narrowest since FY15, driven mainly by import values falling 19.3 percent. Total export values also contracted 7.5 percent due to weak global demand. Despite the global downturn, workers’ remittances increased relative to FY19, underpinning a wider income account surplus. Meanwhile, higher net foreign direct investment, and multilateral and bilateral disbursements, more than offset a decline in portfolio flows, leading to a larger financial account surplus. The balance of payments consequently swung to a surplus of 2.0 percent of GDP in FY20, and official foreign reserves increased to US$13.7 billion at end-June 2020, sufficient to finance 3.2 months of imports.In FY20, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 8.1 percent of GDP from 9.0 percent in FY19. Total revenues rose to 15.3 percent of GDP due to higher non-tax revenue, as the central bank and the telecommunication authority repatriated large profits. Despite reforms, tax revenues slipped to 11.6 percent of GDP, with lower economic activity and larger tax expenditures. Expenditures rose mainly due to a fiscal stimulus package valued at around 2.9 percent of GDP, while the public debt, including guaranteed debt, increased to 93.0 percent of GDP by end-FY20.While domestic economic activity is expected to recover, as lockdown measures are lifted and base effects materialize, Pakistan’s near-term economic prospects are subdued. Significant uncertainty over the evolution of the pandemic and availability of a vaccine, demand compression measures to curb imbalances, along with unfavorable external conditions, all weigh on the outlook. Economic growth is projected to remain below potential, averaging 1.3 percent for FY21-22. This baseline projection, which is highly uncertain, is predicated on the absence of significant infection flare ups or subsequent waves that would require further widespread lockdowns. The current account deficit is expected to widen to an average of 1.5 percent of GDP over FY21-22, with imports and exports gradually picking up as domestic demand and global conditions improve. The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 7.4 percent in FY22, with the resumption of fiscal consolidation and stronger revenues driven by recovering economic activity and structural reform dividends. Expenditures will remain substantial due to sizeable interest payments and defense expenditures, a rising salary and pension bill, and absorption of energy SOE guaranteed debt by the government.There are considerable downside risks to the outlook with the most significant being a resurgence of the COVID-19 infection, triggering a new wave of global and/or domestic lockdowns and further delaying the implementation of critical IMF-EFF structural reforms (slated to resume in H1-FY21). Locust attacks and heavy monsoon rains could lead to widespread crop damage, food insecurity and inflationary pressures. Livelihoods for households dependent primarily on agriculture could also be negatively impacted. Finally, external financing risks could be compounded by difficulties in rolling-over bilateral debt from non-traditional donors and tighter international financing conditions.

The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 7.4 percent in FY22, with the resumption of fiscal consolidation and stronger revenues driven by recovering economic activity and structural reform dividends.

        Pakistan’s real GDP growth is estimated to have declined from 1.9 percent in FY19 to -1.5 percent in FY20. The first contraction in decades, this reflects the effects of COVID-19 containment measures that followed monetary and fiscal tightening prior to the outbreak. To curtail the spread of the pandemic, a partial lockdown – that included restrictions on air travel, inner-city public transport, religious/social gatherings and the closure of all schools and non-essential businesses – was imposed in March, and gradually eased from May 2020 onwards. This disrupted domestic supply and demand, as businesses were unable to operate and consumers curbed expenditures, which specifically affected services and industries. The services sector is estimated to have contracted, by over 1 percent, while industrial production is expected to have declined even more, due to the high policy rates prior to the pandemic and plunging domestic and global demand thereafter. The agriculture sector, partially insulated from the effects of the containment measures, is estimated to have expanded modestly over the year.On the demand side, private consumption is estimated to have contracted in FY20, as households reduced consumption amid the lockdown and dimmer employment prospects. Similarly, with heightened uncertainty, disrupted supply chains and a global slowdown, investment is estimated to have fallen drastically. Exports and imports also shrank given weaknesses in global trade and domestic demand. In contrast, government consumption growth rose, reflecting the rollout of the fiscal stimulus package to cushion the effects of the pandemic.Despite weak activity, consumer price inflation rose from an average of 6.8 percent in FY19 to an average of 10.7 percent in FY20, due to surging food inflation, hikes in administered energy prices, and a weaker rupee, which depreciated 13.8 percent against the U.S. dollar in FY20. With elevated inflationary pressures, the policy rate was held at 13.25 percent from July to February but was subsequently lowered to 7.0 percent over the remainder of FY20 to support dwindling activity and as inflationary expectations fell amid the pandemic.

        The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Pakistan for FY2015-20 is structured to help the country tackle the most difficult—but potentially transformational—areas to reach the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity.The Pakistan team is engaging with stakeholders on the next Country Partnership Framework (CPF) this fiscal year. A Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is currently in final stages of preparation. Both CPF and SCD will draw from the flagship Pakistan@100: Shaping the Future initiative which seeks to identify the main changes necessary for Pakistan to become an upper middle-income country by the time it turns 100 years old in 2047.The four results areas of the current CPS are:Transforming the energy sector: WBG interventions are supporting improved performance of the energy sector by supporting reforms and investments in the power sector to reduce load shedding, expand low-cost generation supply, improve transmission, improve governance and cut losses.Supporting private sector development: A mix of budget support, investments and analytical work supports improvements in Pakistan’s investment climate, in overall competitiveness, agricultural markets and productivity, and skills development. Reaching out to the underserved, neglected, and poor: Investments support financial inclusion, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), women and youth (including through enrollment outcomes), fragile provinces/regions and poorer districts, social protection, and resilience and adaptation to the impact of climate change.Accelerating improvements in service delivery: At the federal and provincial levels the Bank supports increasing revenues to fund services and setting more ambitious stretch targets for areas that are not producing change fast enough (especially education and health). At a provincial level, this involves support to better service delivery in cities.Cross cutting themes for the program include women’s economic empowerment, climate change and resilience, and regional economic connectivity.The WBG has a portfolio of $11.42 billion in Pakistan ($7.5bn IDA, $3.6bn IBRD, $235mn in Trust funds). The portfolio is supporting reforms and investments to strengthen institutions, particularly in fiscal management and human development. Partnerships are being strengthened at provincial levels, focusing on multi-sectoral initiatives in areas such as children's nutrition, education and skills, irrigated agriculture, tourism, disaster risk management, and urban development. Clean energy, and social/financial inclusion, both remain major priorities.

        HEALTHIn the last few years, Pakistan’s health indicators have progressed steadily. The nutritional status of mothers and children has shown progress, though slow and uneven. Stunting rates for children under age 5 have dropped from 44% to 40% from 2011 to 2018. However, large disparities still exist. This prevalence varies from 36% in Punjab to 48% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).While other Maternal and Child Health indicators have improved, significant challenges remain. The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) has improved from 276/100,000 live births in 2006-07 to 186/100,000 live births in 2019. The World Bank, through its Enhanced Nutrition for Mothers and Children Project, which closed last year, and the Sindh Enhanced Response to Reduced Stunting Project (SERRSP), currently under implementation, has supported the provision of nutrition specific and sensitive services.Immunization coverage for children aged 12-23, has increased considerably over the 5-year span from 54% in 2013 to 66% in 2018. Punjab has a coverage rate of 80% for Fully Immunized Children, Sindh and Balochistan are at 49% and 29% respectively. World Bank has been contributing towards this crucial achievement through its National Immunization Support Project (NISP), which has been under implementation since 2016.One of the areas that has remained relatively stagnant over the last few years is family planning. The Total Fertility Rate has declined very marginally from 3.8 in 2013 to 3.6 in 2018.  The Modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (mCPR) has declined from 26% in 2013 to 25% in 2018. In Punjab, where the Bank has been providing support through the Punjab Health Sector Reform Project, the mCPR has been 27%. In other provinces, the mCPR is even lower – as low as 23% in KPK and 14% in Balochistan.The current COVID-19 pandemic has posed extensive challenges and is expected to significantly impact health outcomes resulting from a disruption in provision of essential health services. As Pakistan is now recovering from lockdown, it is expected that regular service provision will resume to cover the gaps that may have developed.Source: Pakistan Demographic & Health Surveys 2006-07, 2012-13 & 2017-18, Maternal Mortality Survey 2019EDUCATIONPunjabBasic Education: Primary education in Punjab is achieving remarkable results in both participation and quality improvement, following an ambitious reform program supported by the PESP-III program. Between 2014 and 2018, school participation rates have gone up from 76% to 81%, and there are now roughly 14 million children enrolled in primary education. For girls, the growth has been particularly large, from 78 to 85% in the primary age group (6-10 years old), and from 65% to 70% in the secondary age group (11-15 years old). School participation has been targeted through perhaps the largest public-private partnership program in the world that now enrolls around 2.6 million children. The province also provides conditional cash transfers to families to keep girls in school, and this is helping the lowest performing districts to substantially increase girls’ enrolment in schools. At the same time, Punjab is trying to reach children as early as possible by developing a 2-year early childhood education (ECE) curriculum. Currently around 4,000 ECE classrooms meet new quality standards, which include the presence of a trained teacher and caregiver as well as a kit with instructional material. These classrooms are monitored by field-based inspectors using smartphone apps, that feed data into a live dashboard, helping policy makers to directly address problems in the field.The quality of education is also improving, although challenges remain. In a recent survey that tracks learning outcomes over time, we found that there has been some progress in both basic Urdu and basic math performance across schools in the province. For instance, between 2004 and 2006, only 32% children in rural schools could answer a three-digit subtraction problem (‘What is the solution to 238-129?’). In a recent survey carried out in 2018, we found that 48% of students could now correctly answer the same question, in the same schools that were surveyed 15 years prior. Moreover, we found that the quality differences between public schools and (low-cost) private schools in both Urdu and math have virtually disappeared (although private schools are still more advanced in English instruction). Further increasing learning outcomes remains the priority of the second-generation reform program in Punjab. In 2016, the province hired almost 100,000 teachers using a standardized test that helped weed out the worst performers. Moreover, the province is leading the way with an innovative way to support better teaching practices in the classroom. School mentors (called AEOs) have started using a the World Bank’s Teach classroom observation tool to provide feedback to teachers on their pedagogic practices. This tool has been providing feedback to 15,000 teachers per week. The focus is now on changing what happens every day in every classroom.The challenges posed by the current COVID-19 crisis and the related school closures have been front and center over the last few months. The World Bank program is supporting the government to develop easy to understand messages on health behaviors, as well as the Taleem Ghar program, which provides distance education over television and digital channels. The Bank is also helping to design re-enrolment campaigns to encourage families to send their children back to schools the moment that the schools re-open.Punjab Skills: The government of Punjab also addressed its strong commitment to build human capital in its Punjab Growth Strategy. It recognizes human capital enhancement as a critical path to improving quality employment and acknowledged skills training as an important tool to achieve this target. To support its objective, Punjab Skills Development Project (2015-2020) has contributed to three strategic areas, including: (i) strengthening of the skills training system, (ii) improving the quality ad relevance of training programs, and (iii) increasing access to market relevant trades. The project developed and implemented new competency-based training and assessment systems in 16 different trades, developed mechanisms for industry-linkages and benefited 2,513 students with more industry relevant training programs. It also benefited 54,818 trainees through short-term training.SindhThe government implemented a comprehensive Education Sector Project between 2014-2018 to improve governance and accountability in the education sector and benefited cumulative 8.5 million students over the project period. A special effort is being made to improve access and retention in selected schools through an improvement of infrastructure of approximately 1,800 classrooms, assigning appropriate number of teachers to school to ensure there is a teacher available for every classroom in the school and train teachers and head teachers of the schools to improve the learning environment. The Government has successfully trained or placed 18,000 additional qualified teachers at government primary schools. The government is providing necessary resources to schools through school specific grants and school management committee grants. The government is implementing a third party led, annual, large scale assessment of Grade 5 and 8 students to track learning outcomes of children in schools. The schools are monitored monthly through the Sindh School Monitoring System, which includes teachers’ biometric attendance monitoring, allowing the Education Department to make evidence-based decisions for education improvements.BalochistanThe Government of Balochistan received $34 million through the Global Partnership for Education and EUR 10 million from the European Union to expand access to quality education. To date, the Balochistan Education Project has helped to functionalize 828 schools across the province including 708 schools with new or renovated buildings and 120 upgraded schools from primary to middle and middle to high. 112,463 children enrolled in the project specific schools with 81% retention of children, of these 77% are girls. All 828 schools have a comprehensive Early Childhood Education (ECE) Program with trained teachers and ECE specific learning material. More than 1,800 project specific teachers have been provided training on pedagogy, subject content especially math and science and ECE. More than 4,000 community members around the school sites have been provided training to support monitoring of school construction, ensure children’s participation in education and ensure teacher presence in schools. Real-Time Monitoring of more than 14,000 public sector schools across the province targeting more than 1 million children enrolled in the schools. Another 1000 classrooms are expected to be functionalized and 100 primary schools are planned to be upgraded to middle schools, supporting an additional 300 government schools and impacting an additional 77,000 students.ENHANCING DISASTER RESILLIENCEBeing one of the most climate-change vulnerable countries in the world and recurrently affected by catastrophes, including the unprecedented 2010 floods which affected over 20 million people, Pakistan’s economy has suffered chronic strain from prevailing and likely future threats of hazards. Since the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, which led to nearly 73,000 deaths and caused damages to over 570,000 houses, the Bank has been supporting the Government of Pakistan in shifting to an anticipatory risk management approach, rather than ex post. Initially, the Bank provided technical assistance to the government to highlight physical and fiscal risks from hazards, including risk assessments of federal and provincial capitals.In parallel, the Bank also used grant resources to build the capacity of Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Balochistan.Following the floods of 2014 and at the request of Government of Pakistan, the Bank prepared the $125 million IDA-funded Disaster and Climate Resilience Improvement Project (DCRIP). The project has supported restoration of more than 200 kilometers of flood protection infrastructure along with strengthening of government capacity to manage disasters and climate variability. Till date the project has improved disaster and climate resilience of nearly 2.5 million beneficiaries across Punjab and Northern Districts.In 2016, the Bank also prepared and delivered the $120 million IDA-funded Sindh Resilience Project (SRP) to mitigate flood and drought risks in selected areas, and strengthen Government of Sindh's capacity to manage natural disasters. About 3.3 million people across the province have benefitted from project interventions till date. The drought mitigation component of the project, comprising construction of small groundwater recharge dams, has already started generating strong development impacts for the target communities.The Bank has also prepared and delivery the $188 million IDA-funded Pakistan Hydromet and Climate Services Project which aims to strengthen Pakistan’s public-sector delivery of reliable and timely hydro-meteorological services and enhance community resilience to shocks. The project is expected to improve weather forecasting in Pakistan and facilitate sustainable management of around 80,000 hectares of forest area.Further, as part of ongoing technical assistance, the Bank is engaged with federal and provincial governments to improve understanding of seismic risks and enhance fiscal resilience to disaster shocks.OPERATING IN CONFLICT AREASThe 2009 conflict in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) led to one of the worst security crises in Pakistan’s history, displacing an estimated two million people and severely disrupting lives, livelihoods, and the provision of public services.A Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established in 2010 to support reconstruction and recovery from the impact of the crisis and reducing the potential for escalation or resumption. The MDTF has a total of $282 million in resources is currently focusing on improving governance, creating jobs, and improving service delivery in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The work of the MDTF is particularly important after the passage of the Thirty-First Amendment to the Constitution by the National Assembly on May 24, 2018, which has merged the seven agencies of FATA with the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

        The Republic of Seychelles lies northeast of Madagascar, an archipelago of 115 islands with almost 98,000 citizens, three-quarters of whom live on the main island of Mahé. Seychelles has the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Africa, at nearly $17 billion (2019), but inequality is significant, placing the prospect of continued shared prosperity in tighter focus. Climate change also poses long-term sustainability risks. Political Context Independent since 1976, the Seychelles is a relatively young democracy: the first multiparty presidential election was held in 1993 after the adoption of a new constitution. A presidential election in December 2015 was closely-fought, and President James Michel narrowly elected for a third and last term by just 193 votes out of the 62,831 valid votes cast. Michel resigned in October 2016, and was replaced by his deputy, Danny Faure. In September 2016’s legislative elections the opposition coalition won the parliamentary elections for the first time. Presidential and parliamentary elections are schedule for October 2020.  Economic developments and outlook Following the economic crisis and resulting sovereign debt default in 2008, the Republic of Seychelles through a prudent reform program made significant progress in achieving economic stability and fiscal sustainability. As a result, the economy grew by an average rate of 4.2% per annum between 2009 and 2019. With the help of an International Monetary Fund program, the government maintained its target of 2.5% primary balance and was on target to reduce the debt to GDP ratio to 50% by 2021. Prudent monetary policy also led to a build-up of the gross international reserves to 3.5 months of import coverage by 2019 from less than one month at end-2008. The economic and social shock from COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the Seychellois economy is severe due to strong dependence on international tourism. Tourism accounts for approximately 30% of gross domestic product (GDP), making the country highly vulnerable to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global outbreak is drastically reducing economic activity in 2020 as tourist arrivals are projected to decline by more than 50%. This is affecting other sectors such as transportation; art, recreation and entertainment; wholesale and retail trade; and the financial and insurance sector. GDP is expected to contract by 15.9% in 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic projected growth rate of 3.5%. Recovery is expected to begin in 2021 with a projected increase of 4.7% driven by a recovery in the tourist industry and a resumption in capital flows. If unmitigated, the poor are expected to bear a disproportionate impact of the economic shock. According to the 2013 household survey, about 6 out of 10 poor individual have a job, mostly in informal activities in the service sector that are expected to experience significant declines.   Development challenges While the immediate priority is the containment of COVID-19 and recovery from its economic and social impact on the country, a focus on longer term structural issues is also warranted for a strong and resilient recovery.   Among Seychelles’ development challenges is the importance to focus on greater productivity, participation and performance of its economy as means to increasing shared prosperity. Some of the main institutional challenges in this regard are notably barriers to open and operate businesses, inefficiencies in public sector management, such as limited statistical capacity, scope for a more strategic and sustainable approach to social protection, as well as the need to broaden access to quality education and skills development. Climate change adaptation, including through strengthened disaster preparedness systems and enhanced coastal management, is also key.

        World Bank Group Engagement in Seychelles The World Bank has delivered a $15 million Development Policy Loan in July 2020 to support Seychelles in its COVID-19 response and prepare the foundations for a strong recovery. The Bank disbursed $7 million in April 2020 from a Catastrophe Draw Down Option (CAT-DDO) emergency credit line that had been in place since 2015. The overarching objective of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Seychelles Country Partnership Framework FY18-FY23, prepared in close consultation with the government, private sector and other development stakeholders, is to consolidate the country’s path to inclusive and sustainable prosperity. To that end, the strategy delineates two mutually reinforcing focus areas, namely shared prosperity, and inclusion and public-sector performance. This entails retooling the core economy of fisheries and tourism for sustainability and inclusion, along the lines of the government’s Blue Economy flagship program, and to strengthen management and resilience of natural endowments. The CPF supports a shift in focus towards building the human capital of the bottom 40% of the population to enable them to participate in new expanding opportunities. Finally, it seeks to consolidate resilience in public finances by increasing their efficiency, improving the regulatory capacity of the state to foster space for the private sector, and setting the foundations for transparency and accountability.  As a means to support the country’s response to the social and economic fallout caused by COVID-19, the WBG has recently approved a $15 million credit from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The Development Policy Lending financing will be utilized to enhance the country’s response mechanisms in health, social protection and private sector, and to support the country’s post-crisis recovery through strengthened financial systems and climate resilience.

        Under the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Program (SWIOFish3), the Bank is supporting the management and conservation of marine areas and strengthening seafood value chains in the Seychelles. The project is co-financed by a Seychelles Blue Bond ($15 million), which is supported by a $5 million guarantee from the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development and a further $5 million concessional loan from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This first ever sovereign Blue Bond was issued by the government of Seychelles in October 2018. The Blue Bond is an innovative financing mechanism to mobilize private sector investment to support the ocean economy. The proceeds are used to capitalize a Blue Grants Fund and a Blue Investment Fund managed by the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT) and the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS).Proceeds from the bond will include support for the expansion of marine protected areas, improved governance of priority fisheries and the development of the Seychelles’ blue economy through activities such as promotion of best practices, implementation of fisheries management plans, stock rebuilding, improvement of value-chains and aquaculture development.

        The World Bank’s office in Rome works to promote consensus around the international development agenda and build a platform for collaboration between the World Bank Group and Spain. It does this by promoting better understanding of the World Bank Group’s mission and activities and by building relationships with key stakeholders such as government, legislators, civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and the media.It also supports outreach activities, often in collaboration with Spanish partners, such as organizing and supporting conferences, seminars, and other events on development-related topics. The office serves as an entry point for groups in Spain wishing to contact World Bank staff across the world or access the plethora of information the Bank publishes, and it responds to media queries. It also seeks to increase opportunities for collaboration between Italy and the World Bank Group through co-financing, trust funds, and joint analytical work in sectors and regions of mutual interest.

        World Bank GovernorMinister of Economy and Digitalization Nadia Calviňo Santamaría represents Spain on the World Bank Board of Governors, the Bank’s senior decision-making body. The Governors, usually Ministers of Finance or Development, meet twice a year. The governors have the power to admit and suspend members of the World Bank Group, increase or decrease the authorized capital stock, determine the distribution of the net income of the Bank, and decide on the World Bank Group’s overall strategic direction. Secretary of State for Economy and Business Affairs Ana de la Cueva Fernandez serves as Spain’s Alternate Governor.World Bank Executive DirectorThe Governor delegates responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day business of Spain’s interests at the Bank to the Executive Director (ED). EDs reside in Washington and normally meet twice a week to decide on borrowing and financial questions, projects, and policies that impact World Bank Group general operations. Spain's executive director also represents Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Eva Valle Maestro is the current ED for Spain on the 25-member World Bank Board of Executive Directors.Shares and Voting PowerThe World Bank Group has a weighted system of voting. All members of the Bank receive votes consisting of share votes (one vote for each share of the Bank's capital stock held by the member) plus basic votes (calculated so that the sum of all basic votes is equal to 5.55% of the sum of basic votes and share votes for all members). The voting power distribution differs from agency to agency within the World Bank Group.For the latest voting status, please visit the Voting Powers page.For information on Spain’s aid flows as a donor, please visit the Aid Flows Spain (PDF) page.

        Now moving into its tenth year, the conflict in Syria has inflicted an almost unimaginable degree of devastation and loss on the Syrian people and their economy. More than 400,000 deaths have been directly attributed to the conflict so far, with millions more non-lethal casualties known to have occurred. More than half the country’s pre-conflict population (of almost 21 million) has been displaced—one of the largest displacements of people since World War II—and, partly as a result, by 2017, economic activity in Syria had shrunk by more than 60% compared to what it had been in 2010. The social and economic impact of the conflict is also large—and growing. A lack of sustained access to health care, education, housing, and food have exacerbated the effects of the conflict and pushed millions of people into unemployment and poverty. With a severely degraded healthcare system, Syrians remain extremely vulnerable to additional shocks, such as the COVID-19 outbreak still unfolding.In addition, a deepening economic and political crisis in neighboring Lebanon and the introduction of the Caesar Law have further restrained Syria’s external economic ties, leading to fuel shortages, price hikes, and a rapid depreciation in local currency.Assessing the Impact of the Syrian Crisis Prior to the conflict, the World Bank Group provided support to Syria through its technical assistance and advisory services on private sector development, human development, social protection, and environmental sustainability. Following the onset of the conflict in 2011, all World Bank operational activity and missions to Syria were halted. Nonetheless, the World Bank monitors the impact of the conflict on the Syrian people and the economy in consultation with other members of the international community. This helps inform international thinking on Syria from an economic and social perspective and build preparedness for post-agreement recovery efforts, when and if mandated. In 2017, the World Bank produced two reports on the impact of the Syrian conflict: (i) a Damage Assessment of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, and (ii) an Economic and Social Impact Analysis of the conflict in Syria, called the Toll of War. Accordingly, from 2011 to 2016, cumulative GDP losses were estimated at US$226 billion. The second study also found that losses caused by the conflict’s disruption of the economy exceeded those losses caused by physical destruction by a factor of 20. The longer the conflict lasts, the more difficult recovery will be, as these losses become more persistent over time. Analyzing the Drivers of Syrian Refugees’ Spontaneous ReturnsThe World Bank’s analytical work program focuses on analyzing policy questions on the Syrian conflict. The Mobility of Displaced Syrians (February 2019) tackled the complex problem of refugee returns. With UNHCR support, the report compared the characteristics of more than 100,000 Syrians UNHCR verified to have returned spontaneously between 2015 and mid-2018, to those of millions of others who did not return in the same period. In explaining their patterns of return, the report analyzed the roles played by the individual economic, social, and demographic characteristics of these groups, as well as the conditions they faced in host countries and the conditions in the places where they were from in Syria. This involved considering both what refugees said (survey responses) and what they did (actual return decisions). Results showed that refugees face a difficult trade-off between living in a secure area and maintaining their quality of life. For instance, when it came to the war’s impact on school-going children, the school attendance ratio of Syrian children remained higher in Syria than it did in Lebanon or Jordan, mainly because many Syrian refugees had to adopt adverse coping strategies in their countries of asylum; Syrian girls dropped out of school to get married at a younger age and Syrian boys dropped out to bring extra income for their families’ survival. For these children, human capital accumulation stops when they leave school, with persistent effects on their lifetime well-being. Nor did improving the conditions of refugees necessarily deter their return: refugees given one more meal per day were 15% more likely to return to Syria than others without. The best results—not only in terms of return but also in regard to the welfare of refugees, their hosts, and Syrians in Syria—was achieved when diversified policy tools were used, including assistance when returning home, service restoration, and support for host communities. Mitigating the Regional Fallout of the Syrian Conflict In June 2020, the World Bank released a Regional Economic and Social Impact Assessment, titled The Fallout of War, which analyzed the impact of the Syrian conflict on the Mashreq region quantitatively, and identified ways in which it had been manifested. The assessment concluded that the Syrian conflict broke down bilateral and transit trade routes, destabilized the region, and led to the largest displacement crisis since the Second World War. As a result, Syria’s neighbors faced the combination of a decrease in economic activity, deterioration in labor markets, and increase in poverty that would have overwhelmed even the world’s most advanced economies.The analysis also suggested that a number of persistent structural weaknesses in the region, including low or deteriorating institutional resilience, reduced the effectiveness of the mitigation policies put into place to deal with the impact of the Syrian crisis. Short-termism in policymaking propagated the shocks caused by the Syrian conflict, leading to costly and ineffective services, lost economic opportunities, and underfunded programs. The report advocated a fundamental shift from short-term mitigation policies to a medium-term regional strategy that would address structural problems. As countries in the Mashreq look toward recovery, policies are needed that take into account the region’s interconnectedness and seek to provide better prospects for people. An approach that addresses cross-boundary issues—including migration, trade, and infrastructure—will require local, regional, and international commitments. In addition to producing analytical products that inform policies, the World Bank also collaborates with a wide range of partners and international financial institutions to help Syrian refugees and their regional hosts. The Global Concessional Financing Facility offers middle-income countries with large numbers of refugees favorable financing terms for development by combining grants from donors with loans from Multilateral Development Banks. To date, the World Bank has supported over US$3 billion worth of projects in Jordan and Lebanon (most on concessional terms) that directly address the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis by seeking to help both refugees and their host communities. These projects support jobs, economic opportunities, health, education, and emergency services to shore up social resilience and local infrastructure. The World Bank also manages the Lebanon Syria Crisis Trust Fund, established in 2014 to provide grant financing to projects mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in Lebanon. The Fund is financed by the Bank’s State- and Peace-Building Trust Fund, as well as the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark. It has supported emergency projects improving education, health, and municipal services, and social safety nets.

More than half the country’s pre-conflict population (of almost 21 million) has been displaced—one of the largest displacements of people since World War II—and, partly as a result, by 2017, economic activity in Syria had shrunk by more than 60% compared to what it had been in 2010. The social and economic impact of the conflict is also large—and growing. A lack of sustained access to health care, education, housing, and food have exacerbated the effects of the conflict and pushed millions of people into unemployment and poverty. With a severely degraded healthcare system, Syrians remain extremely vulnerable to additional shocks, such as the COVID-19 outbreak still unfolding.In addition, a deepening economic and political crisis in neighboring Lebanon and the introduction of the Caesar Law have further restrained Syria’s external economic ties, leading to fuel shortages, price hikes, and a rapid depreciation in local currency.Assessing the Impact of the Syrian Crisis Prior to the conflict, the World Bank Group provided support to Syria through its technical assistance and advisory services on private sector development, human development, social protection, and environmental sustainability. Following the onset of the conflict in 2011, all World Bank operational activity and missions to Syria were halted. Nonetheless, the World Bank monitors the impact of the conflict on the Syrian people and the economy in consultation with other members of the international community. This helps inform international thinking on Syria from an economic and social perspective and build preparedness for post-agreement recovery efforts, when and if mandated. In 2017, the World Bank produced two reports on the impact of the Syrian conflict: (i) a Damage Assessment of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, and (ii) an Economic and Social Impact Analysis of the conflict in Syria, called the Toll of War. Accordingly, from 2011 to 2016, cumulative GDP losses were estimated at US$226 billion. The second study also found that losses caused by the conflict’s disruption of the economy exceeded those losses caused by physical destruction by a factor of 20. The longer the conflict lasts, the more difficult recovery will be, as these losses become more persistent over time. Analyzing the Drivers of Syrian Refugees’ Spontaneous ReturnsThe World Bank’s analytical work program focuses on analyzing policy questions on the Syrian conflict. The Mobility of Displaced Syrians (February 2019) tackled the complex problem of refugee returns. With UNHCR support, the report compared the characteristics of more than 100,000 Syrians UNHCR verified to have returned spontaneously between 2015 and mid-2018, to those of millions of others who did not return in the same period. In explaining their patterns of return, the report analyzed the roles played by the individual economic, social, and demographic characteristics of these groups, as well as the conditions they faced in host countries and the conditions in the places where they were from in Syria. This involved considering both what refugees said (survey responses) and what they did (actual return decisions). Results showed that refugees face a difficult trade-off between living in a secure area and maintaining their quality of life. For instance, when it came to the war’s impact on school-going children, the school attendance ratio of Syrian children remained higher in Syria than it did in Lebanon or Jordan, mainly because many Syrian refugees had to adopt adverse coping strategies in their countries of asylum; Syrian girls dropped out of school to get married at a younger age and Syrian boys dropped out to bring extra income for their families’ survival. For these children, human capital accumulation stops when they leave school, with persistent effects on their lifetime well-being. Nor did improving the conditions of refugees necessarily deter their return: refugees given one more meal per day were 15% more likely to return to Syria than others without. The best results—not only in terms of return but also in regard to the welfare of refugees, their hosts, and Syrians in Syria—was achieved when diversified policy tools were used, including assistance when returning home, service restoration, and support for host communities. Mitigating the Regional Fallout of the Syrian Conflict In June 2020, the World Bank released a Regional Economic and Social Impact Assessment, titled The Fallout of War, which analyzed the impact of the Syrian conflict on the Mashreq region quantitatively, and identified ways in which it had been manifested. The assessment concluded that the Syrian conflict broke down bilateral and transit trade routes, destabilized the region, and led to the largest displacement crisis since the Second World War. As a result, Syria’s neighbors faced the combination of a decrease in economic activity, deterioration in labor markets, and increase in poverty that would have overwhelmed even the world’s most advanced economies.The analysis also suggested that a number of persistent structural weaknesses in the region, including low or deteriorating institutional resilience, reduced the effectiveness of the mitigation policies put into place to deal with the impact of the Syrian crisis. Short-termism in policymaking propagated the shocks caused by the Syrian conflict, leading to costly and ineffective services, lost economic opportunities, and underfunded programs. The report advocated a fundamental shift from short-term mitigation policies to a medium-term regional strategy that would address structural problems. As countries in the Mashreq look toward recovery, policies are needed that take into account the region’s interconnectedness and seek to provide better prospects for people. An approach that addresses cross-boundary issues—including migration, trade, and infrastructure—will require local, regional, and international commitments. In addition to producing analytical products that inform policies, the World Bank also collaborates with a wide range of partners and international financial institutions to help Syrian refugees and their regional hosts. The Global Concessional Financing Facility offers middle-income countries with large numbers of refugees favorable financing terms for development by combining grants from donors with loans from Multilateral Development Banks. To date, the World Bank has supported over US$3 billion worth of projects in Jordan and Lebanon (most on concessional terms) that directly address the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis by seeking to help both refugees and their host communities. These projects support jobs, economic opportunities, health, education, and emergency services to shore up social resilience and local infrastructure. The World Bank also manages the Lebanon Syria Crisis Trust Fund, established in 2014 to provide grant financing to projects mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in Lebanon. The Fund is financed by the Bank’s State- and Peace-Building Trust Fund, as well as the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark. It has supported emergency projects improving education, health, and municipal services, and social safety nets.

        The decline in Gross National Income per capita in Syria, and an increase in poverty in the country, led the World Bank Group to reclassify Syria as eligible for funds from the International Development Association—a fund for the world’s poorest nations—a reclassification that emphasizes the scale of the damage done to Syria’s economy since 2011. The World Bank and its partners will also continue to produce evidence-based assessments with analytical frameworks to help design policies to alleviate adverse effects of the Syrian conflict on the economies of its immediate neighbors.

        Emerging from decades of conflict, Timor-Leste became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century in May 2002.Faced with the task of rebuilding public infrastructure – including roads, ports and airports, water and sanitation systems, and government facilities – and institutional frameworks, Timor-Leste has made significant progress in key areas since independence. Meanwhile, fragility remains a challenge as the country contends with legacies of past conflict.Today, with a population of 1.3 million people, Timor-Leste is a peaceful, democratic nation. While poverty levels remain high, progress has been made in improving living standards. The proportion of Timorese living in poverty declined from 50% in 2007 to an estimated 42% in 2014.Investments in human capital are directly linked to Timor-Leste’s future growth, productivity, and competitiveness. In 2017, the Human Capital Index for Timor-Leste stood at 0.43, as compared to the East Asia and the Pacific’s regional average of 0.61. A healthier and more skilled workforce is necessary to better meet the future labor demands across the economy and increase earnings.  While Timor-Leste has succeeded in saving the proceeds of its natural resource endowment, key remaining challenges include how to increase the productivity and effectiveness of government spending, and how to ensure the environment is preserved as an important economic and social resource for future generations.Encouraging private sector-led growth in the economy will be vital for job creation. In a young country with a fast-changing political and social landscape, there is also a need to focus on improving institutions that create the enabling environment for good policy-making, economic prosperity and inclusivity.

        In November 2019, the World Bank Group approved the Country Partnership Framework for Timor-Leste. This strategy, developed in consultation with various stakeholders following the publication of the first Systematic Country Diagnostic report in late 2018, guides the World Bank Group’s program between the 2020 and 2024 fiscal years.The Framework aims to support the government of Timor-Leste to transform its natural wealth into improved human capital and sustainable infrastructure in three key focus areas:1. Strengthening the foundation for private sector-led growth and economic stabilityEstablish rules-based macroeconomic management and fortifying governance through reforms in public financial managementEnhance the conditions for private investment and promote financial inclusionPromote economic diversification through agribusiness and tourism development2. Investing in human capital and service deliveryStrengthen human capital and promote gender equality3.

        Since 1999, the World Bank has assisted the government of Timor-Leste to rebuild national infrastructure, stabilize the economy, and strengthen government institutions. Some of the achievements from the Bank’s continued support include:Climate-resilient infrastructure: Poor road conditions mean that for many people in Timor-Leste, travel by road can be time consuming, uncomfortable, unsafe, and expensive. Without reliable access to roads, people cannot reach schools, hospitals or markets when they need to.The World Bank’s Timor-Leste Road Climate Resilience Project is restoring a vital 110 kilometers of road corridor, improving access from the North to the South of the island, and connecting the districts of Dili, Aileu, and Ainaro, which jointly account for a third of the country’s population.80% of the road is complete, providing a transport corridor road more resilient to weather events and landslides. Work is underway on the final section of the road, with local farmers and coffee growers benefiting from better access to markets.Similarly, the Branch Roads project aims to rehabilitate a 44.3-kilometer-long road corridor from Gleno to Hatubuilico, linking key farming and tourist destinations to the capital, Dili.Disaster risk management: Through the Community-Based Disaster Risk Management Project, the World Bank is helping communities along the Dili-Ainaro Road, one of Timor-Leste’s most vital road corridors, reduce the impacts of disasters – in particular recurring landslides and consequent road closures.This project is training community members from 26 villages in disaster risk management and helping them prepare comprehensive village-level disaster management plans – supported by small–scale construction and agriculture projects for disaster risk reduction.Nutrition: Working with local partners, the World Bank has completed the implementation of the four-year Community Driven Nutrition Improvement Program in Baucau and Viqueque. The program has improved nutrition practices for households with children in over 300 villages. Overall, 5,000 mothers and their children have benefited from the program.Education: Thousands of young people in Timor-Leste miss out on completing their education due to conflict. through the World Bank-funded Second-Chance Education Project, more than 1,600 youth have now completed recognized school equivalency programs.In addition, to empower communities and support their learning needs, the project supported the creation of nine community learning centers in eight districts across Timor-Leste. The World Bank has also helped the government develop materials for teacher training on early childhood development and in conducting early grade reading assessments, a key tool for designing an appropriate curriculum for Timor-Leste.Tackling poverty: The World Bank assisted Timor-Leste’s Directorate General Statistics to design and implement the 2014 Timor-Leste Living Standard Survey. The Gender-Sensitive Insight of Poverty Mapping for Timor-Leste is a new set of poverty statistics that will enable governments, civil society and development partners to pinpoint areas where development outcomes are lagging.Telecommunications: The World Bank has strengthened the institutional and technical capacity of the Information Communications & Telecommunications (ICT) Unit in the Prime Minister’s Office. Through this support, the government of Timor-Leste has established a policy that addresses all aspects of ICT in Timor-Leste society, including telecommunications, broadcasting and convergent services, and their appropriate regulation. Agriculture: The World Bank’s Sustainable Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project aims to increase the productivity and marketed production of smallholder agriculture in selected geographical locations in Timor-Leste.Through this support, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will directly assist at least 16,500 rural households in four watersheds, reaching approximately 85,000 direct beneficiaries. The project will also indirectly benefit a larger number of households, by supporting watershed-wide and community-level agricultural development planning.Economic monitoring: The Timor-Leste Economic Report  is a six-monthly publication that highlights the latest economic trends and emerging policy challenges in the country. The report draws on ongoing economic monitoring and analysis undertaken by the World Bank with a view to support evidence-based policymaking.

        Political contextA new government led by Hichem Mechichi was sworn in on September 2nd. In his speech before Parliament the day of the confidence vote, Prime Minister Mechichi said his priority is to help address the economic and social situation—stop the bleeding of public finances, start talks with lenders, and begin reform programs, including for public companies and subsidies.Yet since its inauguration, the government has yet to present a clear strategy to address Tunisia’s deep economic and financial challenges, even when the country has reached unprecedented budget deficit levels and deteriorating public services. While the COVID-19 crisis has aggravated the situation, economic resilience had been drained by several years of indecisive public policies and a growing protectionist stance.Macroeconomic contextThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a heavier impact than previously anticipated. The lock-down simultaneously suppressed domestic supply and demand, contracting GDP by 21% (year-over-year) in the second quarter. At the same time, reduced external demand and travel restrictions lowered tourism receipts by 47% and reduced exports of mechanic and electric industry and textiles (Tunisia’s main manufacturing exports) by 27% by (year-over-year) as of mid-2020.Other factors are affecting growth this year. The country suffered from further political upheaval as Elyes Fakhfakh’s recently-formed government fell, which added more uncertainty, and worker disruptions are affecting mining output. Taken together, these factors are contributing to an expected 9% contraction in 2020, down from the first Covid forecast of -4%. In this context, unemployment increased from 15% to 18% in the second quarter of the year, a level last reached in the time of the 2011 revolution.Poverty and vulnerability are expected to grow and invert a trend observed in the last years of fast poverty reduction. According to a series of telephone interviews conducted by INS and the World Bank, there is evidence that pandemic has modified eating habits. Poorer households have reduced quantities consumed or started consuming less preferred foods. To cope with rising food prices or to make up for jobs losses, households drew on their savings, received help or borrowed money from relatives and deferred payment of their obligations. In 2020, extreme poverty—measured using the international poverty line of living on US$1.90 per-day—will still be below 1%; however, poverty measured with the US$3.20 per-day line will increase by about 1.3 percentage points, from 2.9% to 4.2%.  Additionally, the percentage of the population that is “vulnerable” to fall into poverty is expected to increase in 2020. Using an expenditure threshold of US$ 5.50 per-day, the number of poor and of those vulnerable to poverty is expected to increase from 16.6% to 22% of the total population.The current account deficit remains high at an expected 7.1% of GDP in 2020, but it has improved (from 8.8% in 2019) as imports decline at a faster pace than exports. These factors are supporting continued growth in forex reserves, which stood at 142 days of import by August (against 95 days a year earlier).In contrast, the fiscal deficit project to reach 12%, aggravated by an 11% decline in revenues by mid-year, reflecting the reduction in economic activity and tax deferral measures. The wage bill increased by 14% by mid-2020, adding to spending pressures and signaling lack of progress in containing civil service pay. These developments are worsening debt vulnerabilities. Public debt is forecasted to rise from 72.2% of GDP in 2019 to a peak of 86.6% of GDP in 2020, well above the emerging market debt burden benchmark of 70% of GDP.

        Outlook After an expected 9% contraction in 2020, growth is temporarily expected to accelerate to around 6% as the pandemic’s effects abate. But after this short-term uptick, growth is expected to return to a more subdued trajectory at around 2% , reflecting Tunisia’s weak investment climate and slow structural transformation. In line with this, the current account deficit is expected to improve as export industries begin to recover but at a sluggish pace given persistent structural constraints and political uncertainty. The fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 8.1% of GDP in 2020 and decline gradually to 4.5% by 2022, with downside risks from a growing wage bill.The outlook for reforms to support the recovery is challenging. With the population already strained by this unprecedented shock, space to improve the fiscal outlook by reducing the wage bill and untargeted subsidies is narrow. Structural reforms to address SOE performance, increase market contestability, and a clamp down on corruption are even more necessary, as a clear political champion for such reforms has yet to emerge. Security risks are a further concern for the outlook. Following an increase in 2020, poverty is expected to begin declining from 2021 onwards, but at a slow pace. PortfolioIPF projects focus on the core issues facing the country, namely creating economic opportunities in inland regions, focusing on youth, and using technology to address service delivery failures. Difficulties encountered in the implementation of the projects and late effectiveness of 3 projects, intensified by the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, resulted in a decrease of the disbursement rate and the performance of the portfolio.World Bank efforts in Tunisia include a new COVID emergency operation (US$20 million), as well as significant restructuring of multiple projects in the portfolio to: (i) increase immediate liquidity to finance equipment and supply for healthcare facilities needed for COVID-19; and (ii) help mitigate the economic and social impact. At end of FY20, the disbursement ratio reached 18.5%.The World Bank also led a group of donors in a joint budget support operation (US$175 million) with Japan, KfW, Agence Française de Développement (AFD), and the African Development Bank (AfDB), in coordination with the EU, which was approved on June 12, 2020.  Overall contributions, including the EU’s macro-financial assistance, could have reached US$1.3 billion, but will likely be significantly lower due to the slowdown in the process of finalization and ratification of these support packages.For Fiscal Year 2021, the World Bank plans to deliver four operations:Tunisia Integrated Disaster Resilience Program (Program for Results, US$25 million), co-financed with AFD ($50m);Tunisia Economic Development Corridor Project (Investment Project Financing, US$200 million);Tunisia Sanitation Public-Private Partnership Support Project (Investment Project Financing, US$133.5 million);TN-Sustainable Oasis Landscape Management Project (Investment Project Financing, US$50 million).Discussions on exposure guarantee arrangements with partners are continuing to allow the Bank to continue to deliver our lending program.Tunisia has 15 active IBRD projects, with commitments totaling US$1.66 billion. There are thirteen Investment Project Financing operations (totaling US$1.03 billion); one Program for Results (US$430 million); one Development Policy Financing operation (US$175 million); and 2 grants (totaling US$14.63 million) in the current portfolio.

        Economic OverviewUganda’s economy has experienced a slowdown in growth due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic crisis, a locust invasion and flooding caused by heavy rains. Uganda’s real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 is projected to be between 0.4 and 1.7% compared to 5.6% in 2019. Exports, tourism, remittances, foreign direct investment and portfolio flows shrunk during the second half of FY20 due to international trade disruptions and restrictions of movement of people. This has created significant fiscal and external imbalance, and a deceleration in growth in services, primarily in real estate activities and information and communications technology.  The medium-term outlook is also not favorable for Uganda. The decline in Uganda’s real GDP growth and corresponding loss of jobs could be even larger if the country were to face a more widespread pandemic and further locust invasions, as this could deter a rapid economic recovery. Heightened uncertainty around the upcoming February 2021 elections further exacerbate these risks. While about 700,000 young people reach working age every year in Uganda, only 75,000 jobs are created each year. This leaves more than 70% of Ugandans employed in agriculture, mainly on a subsistence basis. An average of one million young people are expected to reach working age between 2030-2040.   Finally, regional instability, pandemic preparedness (Ebola and coronavirus) and broader global trade uncertainty could undermine exports and affect growth and have implications for debt sustainability and the current account. Development Challenges Uganda has achieved remarkable results in reducing poverty over the past decades, mainly driven by the agriculture sector. From 1992 to 2013, the percentage of Ugandan households living in poverty was halved, but vulnerability to external shocks remains high; for every three Ugandans who get out of poverty, two fall back in. All Uganda’s regions registered an increase in the number of poor people with the notable exception of the Northern region, which is the poorest, and where poverty decreased from 44% to 33%. COVID19 has worsened the effects of poverty and up to three million people could fall into poverty particularly in urban areas, above the estimated 8.7 million in FY17. Current social protection programs are inadequate, reaching just 3% of the population and increasing overall vulnerability to shocks. Human Capital in Uganda Uganda’s Human Capital Index (HCI) is low; a child born in Uganda today is expected to be 38% as productive when she grows up, as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. A child in Uganda completes seven years of education by age 18, compared to 8.1 for their regional counterparts. However, actual years of learning are 4.5, with the 2.5 years considered ‘wasted’ due to poor quality of education. For instance, only 6% of children in Uganda can read a paragraph at the end of the fourth grade. Undernutrition is high and stunting affects one-third of all children in Uganda aged five years and below. At 3%, Uganda’s annual population growth rate is among the highest in the world, despite a reduction in fertility rates. Uganda’s population of 35 million is expected to reach 100 million by 2050, while the annual urban growth rate of 5.2% is among the highest in the world and is expected to grow from 6.4 million (2014) to 22 million by 2040. Uganda’s refugee population has almost tripled since July 2016 and is currently around 1.4 million, making it the largest refugee host in Africa, and third largest in the world. While its open-door refugee policy is one of the most progressive in the world with refugees enjoying access to social services, land and can move and work freely, the continued influx is straining host communities and service delivery.

        World Bank Group (WBG) EngagementThe World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2016-2021 supports the government’s vision of a society transformed from a peasant economy to a modern, prosperous country by 2040. The CPF was been prepared in close collaboration with the government, and is informed by consultations with civil society, private sector, academia, development partners, and the public. It recognizes the dynamic between rural and urban development where, in the short run, poverty reduction will come from rural areas. The focus in the medium-term will shift towards urbanization and the creation of jobs for a rapidly growing labor force.The investment portfolio in Uganda is primarily financed by the International Development Association (IDA), which provides interest-free credits and grants on concessional terms, attracting only an administrative service charge of 0.75% on the disbursed credit amount. Loan repayments are stretched over 38 years, including a six-year grace period.As of February 2020, the Bank’s portfolio of IDA-financed credits and grants stood at $2.9 billion in net commitment for 17 national and seven regional operations. More than 70% of the investment is supporting infrastructure development, including in health and education.The International Finance Corporation (IFC)As of February 2020, the IFC had commitments totaling to $174.6 million mainly in infrastructure, the financial market, agribusiness, education and energy. The IFC has worked closely with the Bank and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency on private power generation and distribution projects and continues to collaborate closely within the World Bank Group on renewable energy.Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)MIGA’s portfolio has a combined gross exposure of $427.8 million, primarily focusing on guarantees covering investments in energy infrastructure, and banking. MIGA also supported Sithe Global (USA) with guarantees of $120 million covering its equity investment in Bujagali Energy Ltd.Support to Uganda’s COVID-19 Response Efforts To help the government prevent, detect and respond to the pandemic, and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, $15 million was triggered under the Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) of the Uganda Reproductive Maternal and Child Health Services Improvement Project. CERC funding supports prevention and early detection, helps to procure Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for health workers, hand sanitizers, testing kits, transport media and consumables, thermal scanners, screening equipment. Other activities include risk communication and community engagement to raise awareness about the risk factors for COVID-19. CERC funds will be replenished in an additional financing currently being prepared. In addition to the CERC activation, the closing date for the East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project was extended to March 30, 2021, to enable completion of isolation facilities at the Entebbe General Hospital and Mulago National Referral Hospital. The Bank also recently approved $15.2 million Uganda COVID-19 Response and Emergency Preparedness Project to reduce the financing gap under the National COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan in a new operation. The project is financed by an IDA credit of $12.5 million and a grant of $2.7 million from the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility. A $300 million budget support operation was approved to extend subsidies and tax exemption to supplies and equipment used in treatment of COVID-19 and provide immediate relief to individual and businesses that have been most affected by the pandemic.  Other emergency response interventions are being coordinated with existing programs including in agriculture, water and sanitation, refugee and host communities, environment, and private sector development and job creation.

        Economic OverviewUganda’s economy has experienced a slowdown in growth due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic crisis, a locust invasion and flooding caused by heavy rains. Uganda’s real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 is projected to be between 0.4 and 1.7% compared to 5.6% in 2019. Exports, tourism, remittances, foreign direct investment and portfolio flows shrunk during the second half of FY20 due to international trade disruptions and restrictions of movement of people. This has created significant fiscal and external imbalance, and a deceleration in growth in services, primarily in real estate activities and information and communications technology.  The medium-term outlook is also not favorable for Uganda. The decline in Uganda’s real GDP growth and corresponding loss of jobs could be even larger if the country were to face a more widespread pandemic and further locust invasions, as this could deter a rapid economic recovery. Heightened uncertainty around the upcoming February 2021 elections further exacerbate these risks. While about 700,000 young people reach working age every year in Uganda, only 75,000 jobs are created each year. This leaves more than 70% of Ugandans employed in agriculture, mainly on a subsistence basis. An average of one million young people are expected to reach working age between 2030-2040.   Finally, regional instability, pandemic preparedness (Ebola and coronavirus) and broader global trade uncertainty could undermine exports and affect growth and have implications for debt sustainability and the current account. Development Challenges Uganda has achieved remarkable results in reducing poverty over the past decades, mainly driven by the agriculture sector. From 1992 to 2013, the percentage of Ugandan households living in poverty was halved, but vulnerability to external shocks remains high; for every three Ugandans who get out of poverty, two fall back in. All Uganda’s regions registered an increase in the number of poor people with the notable exception of the Northern region, which is the poorest, and where poverty decreased from 44% to 33%. COVID19 has worsened the effects of poverty and up to three million people could fall into poverty particularly in urban areas, above the estimated 8.7 million in FY17. Current social protection programs are inadequate, reaching just 3% of the population and increasing overall vulnerability to shocks. Human Capital in Uganda Uganda’s Human Capital Index (HCI) is low; a child born in Uganda today is expected to be 38% as productive when she grows up, as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. A child in Uganda completes seven years of education by age 18, compared to 8.1 for their regional counterparts. However, actual years of learning are 4.5, with the 2.5 years considered ‘wasted’ due to poor quality of education. For instance, only 6% of children in Uganda can read a paragraph at the end of the fourth grade. Undernutrition is high and stunting affects one-third of all children in Uganda aged five years and below. At 3%, Uganda’s annual population growth rate is among the highest in the world, despite a reduction in fertility rates. Uganda’s population of 35 million is expected to reach 100 million by 2050, while the annual urban growth rate of 5.2% is among the highest in the world and is expected to grow from 6.4 million (2014) to 22 million by 2040. Uganda’s refugee population has almost tripled since July 2016 and is currently around 1.4 million, making it the largest refugee host in Africa, and third largest in the world. While its open-door refugee policy is one of the most progressive in the world with refugees enjoying access to social services, land and can move and work freely, the continued influx is straining host communities and service delivery.

        The Bank is a co-chair and secretariat to the Local Development Partner’s Group (LDPG). Following measures to curtail COVID19 (coronavirus) in Uganda, the LDPG shifted to a virtual format and focuses on time-critical points, ensuring collective efforts consider all aspects of the impact. They hold joint LDPG-Government meetings, also in virtual format, to ensure continuation of the partnership dialogue and to maximize support in a coordinated manner.  Supported by the technical working groups under the LDPG, and in close consultation with the respective government counterparts, partners are in the process of developing a comprehensive analysis including impact and Government/Development Partners’ responses to COVID 19 in the areas of health, macro-economics and refugees. Similar efforts are being done for the locust response.

        A vast country with a long coastline and central plateau, Angola thrusts inland across Southern Africa to border Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its principal cities, including its capital, Luanda, look west over the South Atlantic to Brazil, another Portuguese-speaking nation (like itself). It has a population of more than 30 million (2018). Economic Overview Despite significant progress on macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, Angola is still suffering the effects of lower oil prices and production levels, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) contraction around 1.2% in 2018. The oil sector accounts for one-third of GDP and more than 90% of exports. The transformation of a state-led oil economy to a private-sector-led growth model is a complex and long-term process and the oil sector will continue to play an important role during this transition period. Macroeconomic stability has been restored and maintained through a more flexible exchange rate regime, restrictive monetary policy, and fiscal consolidation. The government has delivered on several key reforms since taking office in 2017, including the new law on Preventing and Combating Money Laundering, as well as the privatization law, the setup of a one-stop window for investors to improve the business climate, and the establishment of a social protection registry to protect the most vulnerable from the reforms. These reforms are already producing some positive results, as Angola tapped the Eurobond market again in the amount of $3.0 billion, and the IMF has approved the second review of the EFF program in December 2019. The Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) has maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance to anchor inflation and to offset the impact of the exchange rate devaluation. The BNA continued its efforts to reach a more flexible exchange rate by allowing the oil companies to sell foreign exchange directly to commercial banks, contributing to strengthen buffers against external shocks. Inflation remained high but continued to decline from 18.6% in 2018 to 16.9% in 2019, reflecting weak economic activity and muted exchange rate pass-through. The authorities are actively addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. The BNA increased minimum capital requirements for banks. An Asset Quality Review (AQR) was conducted with the support of IMF and has indicated that the financial sector is sound.  Angola is expected to remain in recession in 2020 due to the recent plunge in oil prices and the global slowdown resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Oil sector growth will be highly affected due to the combined effect of supply and demand shocks. Non-oil sector growth is also projected to decline due to spillover effects from lower oil prices, reduced imported capital goods, tighter financing conditions, currency depreciation, and restrictions in the movements of goods and people The COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic disruptions caused by it put at risk Angola’s achievements of macro-economic stabilization and transition to a more sustainable and inclusive growth model.  Political Context Angola has maintained political stability since the end of the 27-year civil war in 2002.

        World Bank Group Commitment to Angola World Bank Group (WBG) activities in Angola are undertaken as part of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2014-2016 and which were extended through 2018. The overarching strategy of the CPF is the promotion of more inclusive development, and it consists of two core objectives (pillars), and one foundation plank possessing a cross-cutting nature. The pillars and foundation are as follows: Pillar I focuses on supporting integrated national economic diversification by revitalizing rural economies to create greater competitiveness and employment. The focus is on the strengthening of the non-oil economy, with an emphasis on rehabilitating traditional lines of business that suffered greatly during the war, as well as technical assistance for the energy sector. Pillar II focuses on enhancing the quality of service delivery and instituting a strong social protection program to improve the quality of life of the population and equip individuals to take a greater role in the development of the country. The Foundation Plank of the CPS revolves around building human and institutional capacity to approach the levels common in middle-income countries, complementing the two strategic pillars. These objectives will be achieved during the CPF period through stronger attention to quality and implementation of the seven existing projects with International Development Association (IDA), and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financing, and the three current Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS). The current World Bank portfolio is comprised of nine investment projects (IDA/IBRD) with a total net commitment of nearly $1.8 billion dollars.

The government has delivered on several key reforms since taking office in 2017, including the new law on Preventing and Combating Money Laundering, as well as the privatization law, the setup of a one-stop window for investors to improve the business climate, and the establishment of a social protection registry to protect the most vulnerable from the reforms. These reforms are already producing some positive results, as Angola tapped the Eurobond market again in the amount of $3.0 billion, and the IMF has approved the second review of the EFF program in December 2019. The Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) has maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance to anchor inflation and to offset the impact of the exchange rate devaluation. The BNA continued its efforts to reach a more flexible exchange rate by allowing the oil companies to sell foreign exchange directly to commercial banks, contributing to strengthen buffers against external shocks. Inflation remained high but continued to decline from 18.6% in 2018 to 16.9% in 2019, reflecting weak economic activity and muted exchange rate pass-through. The authorities are actively addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. The BNA increased minimum capital requirements for banks. An Asset Quality Review (AQR) was conducted with the support of IMF and has indicated that the financial sector is sound.  Angola is expected to remain in recession in 2020 due to the recent plunge in oil prices and the global slowdown resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Oil sector growth will be highly affected due to the combined effect of supply and demand shocks. Non-oil sector growth is also projected to decline due to spillover effects from lower oil prices, reduced imported capital goods, tighter financing conditions, currency depreciation, and restrictions in the movements of goods and people The COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic disruptions caused by it put at risk Angola’s achievements of macro-economic stabilization and transition to a more sustainable and inclusive growth model.  Political Context Angola has maintained political stability since the end of the 27-year civil war in 2002. In 2010, a constitution established a presidential parliamentary system with the president no longer elected by direct popular vote but instead as the head of the party winning the most seats.  While no official statement has been made thus far, the planned local elections scheduled for 2020 are likely to be postponed due to the crises posed by covid-19 and low oil prices.   Internationally, Angola is becoming more assertive and demonstrating a more steadfast commitment to peace and stability in Africa, particularly in the Great Lakes region. Very recently it facilitated an agreement to end mounting tensions between the neighbors Rwanda and Uganda.   Development Challenges Angola has made substantial economic and political progress since the end of the war in 2002. However, the country continues to face massive development challenges, which include reducing its dependency on oil and diversifying the economy; rebuilding its infrastructure; and improving institutional capacity, governance, public financial management systems, human development indicators, and the living conditions of the population. Large pockets of the population live in poverty without adequate access to basic services, and the country could benefit from more inclusive development policies. According to 2018/2019  Expenditure and Income Survey from national institute of statistics, poverty index was at 40.6%. A social protection scheme program has been launched with a pilot cash transfer project which will benefit over 1.6 million vulnerable families until 2022 across the country.

        The World Bank (WB) has successfully contributed to Angola’s development by providing support in the following areas:Human Capital The Health System Performance Strengthening Project (HSPSP) is targeting more than 200,000 people in five municipalities in which a Results-Based Financing pilot called PASSABEM is being implemented. Currently the project has:Identified and registered more than 103,000 beneficiaries representing 51.4% of the estimated populationIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project made $15 million available for the urgent and immediate health sector response, and supported World Bank technical assistance in conducting a quantification of the COVID-19 needs which served as the basis to outline needs areas, inform procurement, and help coordinate donor supportPurchased personal protective equipment, bio-security and diagnostic materials, and the operationalization of the logistical response which included contact-tracing and field-based trainingThe Learning for All Project envisages improving teacher’s skills and knowledge as well as school management in Project-designated areas. The project also envisages to develop a system for systematic student assessment. To date, the project has: Established 167 pedagogical influencing zones (ZIP) in the project implementation areas. A ZIP model creates a school network in which schools share and collaborate with each other in their day-to-day work to deliver high quality education. Each ZIP comprises six to seven primary schools which are within a radio not exceeding 10 kilometers and are led by a coordinator who has been trained by the project to act as trainer of trainers.The project has covered four out of the six modules planned for the training program. In these modules, a total of nearly 15,000 teachers have been trained on methodology of teaching Portuguese language, mathematics, pedagogical supervision, assessment in the classroom and pedagogical differentiationWater  The first phase of the Water Sector Institutional Development Program (WSIDP), also known as PDISA:Supported the creation and strengthening of six new water supply utilities that are providing household services to more than 800,000 new customersThe utilities financial and operational performance has improved significantly.A new regulator and a new water resources management institution have similarly been created with project support and are carrying out their mandates. Additionally, 1,000 km of network was installed in Uige, Malanje, Ndalatando, Huambo, Kuito, Lubango and Luena.A second generation of the project, WSIDP2 ($350 million), is now effective and will scale up the infrastructure activities, provide increased institutional strengthening and incorporate sanitation activities. WSIDP2 also secured funds from the Agence Française de Développement ($150 million) and the European Investment Bank ($100 million).Social and Economic Infrastructure The Angola Social Action Fund, commonly known as “Fundo de Apoio Social” (FAS), has been the main World Bank Group (WBG) support program that contributes to promoting decentralization. The project, which has improved poor communities’ access to basic social and economic infrastructure and provision of services, has been in implementation in various phases since 1994. The Local Development Project (PDL), is in its fourth phase, including a recently approved International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Additional Financing. The project:Provides direct financial support and capacity development assistance to poor communities, complementing the government’s efforts in the decentralization processDuring the third phase of the project, 1,575 pieces of community infrastructure were constructed and rehabilitated in all 18 provinces of the country, enabling about 2.3 million Angolans to gain access to basic social and economic servicesMechanisms and practices for participatory governance systems have been established, in which local governments are increasingly more accountable to their constituenciesAbout 7,200 individuals have benefited from the project’s capacity development activities, half of whom received formal trainingAgriculture The Market Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (MOSAP) supports beneficiaries by providing training and new technologies, improving their organizational and marketing skills, and improving their access to extension services and agricultural inputs. It has also:Supported strengthening the farmers’ organizationsAbout 725 farmers’ field schools were created by the project and helped train more than 50,0000 smallholder famers to boost the production of the major crops targeted by the project

        A vast country with a long coastline and central plateau, Angola thrusts inland across Southern Africa to border Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its principal cities, including its capital, Luanda, look west over the South Atlantic to Brazil, another Portuguese-speaking nation (like itself). It has a population of more than 30 million (2018). Economic Overview Despite significant progress on macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, Angola is still suffering the effects of lower oil prices and production levels, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) contraction around 1.2% in 2018. The oil sector accounts for one-third of GDP and more than 90% of exports.

        Country ContextThe political system in BiH is complex, reflecting the provisions of the country’s constitution developed to end ethnic conflict, as well as subsequent changes to the system introduced under the guidance of the international community through the Office of the High Representative.In July 2015, the Council of Ministers of BiH, Government of Republika Srpska (RS), and Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) adopted a joint program of structural reforms known as the reform agenda. This reform agenda presents a rare window of opportunity for structural reforms in BiH, underpinned by a broad national consensus on the country’s critical challenges and priorities and the sustained support of key development partners.BiH’s key economic challenge is the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports.The country needs to shift to a business environment conducive to private investment that supports both vibrant small and medium-sized enterprises and the growth of larger companies, facilitates export performance and productivity improvements, and generates much-needed private sector employment.At the same time as addressing these imbalances in the economic model, the country must also ensure the sustainability and inclusiveness of future growth.

        StrategyTo design this new strategy, a systematic diagnostic analysis was carried out to clarify the challenges that BiH faces on the road to growth and prosperity and to identify possible solutions.The WBG Country Partnership Framework for 2016–20 provides analysis, advice, and financing to accelerate the implementation of reforms designed to promote economic growth.The fundamental conclusion is that BiH can attain sustainable growth that will benefit broad groups of society only if it takes decisive steps to make the public sector leaner and more efficient and to unleash the growth and job creating potential of the private sector.Through the strategic framework, the WBG supports reforms in three areas:Increasing public sector efficiency and effectivenessCreating conditions for accelerated private sector growthBuilding resilience to natural shocksKey EngagementImproving Road Connectivity and Safety in BiH. A €58 million International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan for the Federation Road Sector Modernization Project was approved in August 2016, cofinanced by the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. This project is the first Bank operation in the transport sector in BiH since 2007, reflecting a renewed focus on connectivity and the need to strengthen key economic infrastructure as the country advances toward EU accession.The project aims to improve road connectivity and safety for users along selected roads and to strengthen capacity for sustainable management of the main road network in FBiH. Fully 178 kilometers of main roads will be rehabilitated, including three tunnels and nine bridges. Additionally, the construction of the new route M17.3 (Neum-Stolac road) should stimulate growth in the southern parts of BiH through improved accessibility to the Adriatic coast, boosting tourism development and creating jobs.In addition to infrastructure works, the project will support the Public Enterprise Roads FBiH in its efforts to improve the financial sustainability of these and future investments and to streamline climate resilience and road safety considerations into road design and construction, ensuring a better understanding of the network’s potential vulnerabilities to extreme weather and climate change.The project is the first phase of the BiH Transport Sector Modernization Program and will be implemented in FBiH. The Program, organized as a series of projects, will flexibly support the longterm development of transport in BiH, allowing for subsequent phases to be developed in other parts of the country as technical and financial opportunities arise.

        View All Active ProjectsProject SpotlightBetter than Before - Rebuilding in Bosnia and HerzegovinaIn May 2014, unprecedented rainfall in BiH affected more than 1 million people (25% of the population), and the resulting heavy flooding caused estimated damages and losses equivalent to nearly 15% of the country’s GDP.In a country where one- fifth of the workforce is employed in agriculture, river floods inundated newly plowed fields and ravaged 81 municipalities, severely disrupting the economy and imperiling livelihoods. The World Bank participated in a systematic recovery needs assessment, led by the BiH authorities and supported also by the EU and the United Nations. The assessment provided a basis for developing effective rehabilitation measures for infrastructure and services in the affected areas.In response to the crisis, the Bank promptly met the Government’s request to provide financial support for emergency goods and the rehabilitation of highpriority infrastructure by approving a US$100 million from the WBG’s Crisis Response Window. The project was declared effective within a record two and a half months after approval.Key project results to date:Overall, by delivering emergency recovery goods and supporting the rehabilitation of regional and local infrastructure, the project has benefited over 580,000 people in flood affected areas.

        CONTEXTBotswana is located at the center of Southern Africa, positioned between South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. One of the world’s poorest countries at independence in 1966, it rapidly became one of the world’s development success stories. Significant mineral (diamond) wealth, good governance, prudent economic management and a relatively small population of slightly more than two million, have made it an upper middle-income country with a transformation agenda of becoming a high-income country by 2036.Political ContextBotswana’s stable political environment includes a multi-party democratic tradition, with general elections held every five years. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has been in power since 1966. In October 23, 2019 Botswana held its 11th general elections, with His Excellency President Dr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi assuming the presidency. The new cabinet was announced on Nov 6, 2019 and Honorable Dr. Thapelo Matsheka was appointed the Minister of Finance and Economic Development.Economic OverviewBotswana has historically enjoyed strong and stable growth since independence, with sizable fiscal buffers and prudent policies playing a key role in shielding the economy. More recently, however, the limitations of Botswana’s diamond-led development model have become more apparent: growth is slower, inequality remains high and job creation is limited. At the same time, increased diamond market volatility—including growing competition from synthetic diamonds, reduced Southern African Customs Union transfers and fiscal expansion have resulted in eroded fiscal buffers.Botswana’s economy faces an unprecedented challenge due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, only a year after weakening global demand for diamonds and severe droughts led to a slowdown in growth to 3 percent in 2019 (from 4.5% in 2018). The economy is expected to contract by at least 9.1% in 2020 as COVID-19’s impact on global demand, travel restrictions and social distancing measures constrain output in key production and export sectors, including the diamond industry and tourism. Both external and fiscal pressures will become accentuated in 2020, with the overall deficit set to double (from 4% of GDP last year). Nevertheless, debt levels are set to likely remain below prudence levels.Developments in the global diamond industry will have a telling impact on the short-term recovery given Botswana’s dependence on the commodity. Whilst a mild recovery is expected for 2021, the economic impact of COVID-19 is likely to be deep and long-lasting. The authorities’ ability to advance on key reforms laid out in its 2020-2023 Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan will thus play a key role in creating conditions for broad-based growth and thus improving Botswana’s economic performance.Social ContextLiving conditions have improved for the Botswana people, and poverty has fallen significantly. The share of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at the 2011 Purchasing Power Parity declined steadily from 29.8% to 18.2% between 2002–03 and 2009–10, and to 16.1% in 2015-16. This rapid poverty reduction can be attributed mainly to a combination of increasing agricultural incomes, including subsidies, and demographic changes.Progress in reducing poverty has been accompanied by improvements in shared prosperity. The growth rate of consumption per capita between 2009–10 and 2015-16 for the bottom 40 percentile of the population was 0.42% annually, higher than the growth rate of the top 60 percentile. However, Botswana's performance was only in the middle of the worldwide shared-prosperity distribution.Inequality has fallen as well, albeit still being high. Between 2010 and 2015, inequality, measured by the Gini index, fell from 60.5% to 53.3%. Among factors associated with Botswana's declining income inequality, the key one is regional convergence due to fast growth in rural areas and demographic changes. However, Botswana remains one of the world's most unequal countries.The recent Botswana Multi-Topic Survey: Labour Force Module Report indicates that the unemployment rate has gone up by 3.1 percentage points from 17.6% to 20.7% with youth unemployment posing a critical challenge. Addressing these challenges will require improving the quality of infrastructure (water and electricity), essential basic services (education, health, and social safety nets), as well as accelerating reforms to the business environment and effective support for entrepreneurship.The World Bank’s Human Capital Index (HCI) scores Botswana at 0.42. The purpose of the HCI is to promote attention and action to improving the level and quality of government investments in child health, nutrition, and education given their strong links to labor productivity and economic competitiveness. Botswana’s HCI score suggests that a Motswana child born today will only be 42% as productive when she grows up as she could have been if she had enjoyed complete education and health. Education expenditure is among the highest in the world and includes the provision of nearly universal free primary education but has not created a skilled workforce.

        The World Bank’s engagement in Botswana is focused on helping the country consolidate its progress while addressing a range of emerging challenges and notable declines in some key areas.The World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period of FY16–FY21  is closely aligned with the Government’s National Development Plan 11 (NDP 11) and Botswana’s Vision 2036 goals. The CPF was informed by the Systematic Country Diagnostic endorsed in March 2015 and developed in consultation with the Botswana government.The CPF is supporting Botswana’s development goals by focusing on the three pillars: (i) promoting private sector-led, jobs intensive growth; (ii) strengthening human and physical assets; and (iii) supporting effective resource management. The Country Partnership Framework was updated through the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) approved in March 2019.

The share of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at the 2011 Purchasing Power Parity declined steadily from 29.8% to 18.2% between 2002–03 and 2009–10, and to 16.1% in 2015-16. This rapid poverty reduction can be attributed mainly to a combination of increasing agricultural incomes, including subsidies, and demographic changes.Progress in reducing poverty has been accompanied by improvements in shared prosperity. The growth rate of consumption per capita between 2009–10 and 2015-16 for the bottom 40 percentile of the population was 0.42% annually, higher than the growth rate of the top 60 percentile. However, Botswana's performance was only in the middle of the worldwide shared-prosperity distribution.Inequality has fallen as well, albeit still being high. Between 2010 and 2015, inequality, measured by the Gini index, fell from 60.5% to 53.3%. Among factors associated with Botswana's declining income inequality, the key one is regional convergence due to fast growth in rural areas and demographic changes. However, Botswana remains one of the world's most unequal countries.The recent Botswana Multi-Topic Survey: Labour Force Module Report indicates that the unemployment rate has gone up by 3.1 percentage points from 17.6% to 20.7% with youth unemployment posing a critical challenge. Addressing these challenges will require improving the quality of infrastructure (water and electricity), essential basic services (education, health, and social safety nets), as well as accelerating reforms to the business environment and effective support for entrepreneurship.The World Bank’s Human Capital Index (HCI) scores Botswana at 0.42. The purpose of the HCI is to promote attention and action to improving the level and quality of government investments in child health, nutrition, and education given their strong links to labor productivity and economic competitiveness. Botswana’s HCI score suggests that a Motswana child born today will only be 42% as productive when she grows up as she could have been if she had enjoyed complete education and health. Education expenditure is among the highest in the world and includes the provision of nearly universal free primary education but has not created a skilled workforce.

        Integrated Transport Project ($186 million): The World Bank Group (WBG) is supporting the government in its efforts to improve transport infrastructure development by introducing methodologies on Output-and Performance-Based Road Contracting (OPRC), at an estimated 335km road network. Also, improving Urban Infrastructure Investments in Greater Gaborone as well as supporting technical studies on urban planning.Emergency Water Security and Efficiency Project ($145.5 million): The WBG is supporting Botswana in its efforts to increase  the availability of water in drought vulnerable areas and develop  wastewater management in selected systems, and lastly strengthen capacity on drought risk management and resilience. Morupule B Generation and Transmission Project: The WBG has provided a partial credit guarantee of $242 million under the Morupule B Generation and Transmission project to extend the maturity of the commercial loan to the government to 20-year period until 2030.The Economic Diversification and Competitiveness Reimbursable Advisory Service Program ($3.6 million): The WBG provides support to encourage economic diversification through doing business reforms, entrepreneurship, secured transaction reform and analysis of labor market skills gap.Social Protection Modernization: Since 2013 the WBG has been supporting government through trust funded technical assistance to develop a national social protection framework, design poverty-based targeting methodology, design and pilot social registry and develop generic MIS customized to an ongoing government program. The trust fund support will end in October 2020.Renewable Energy: WBG assisted with developing the Renewable and Energy Efficiency Strategies with an Off-Grid action Plan, which were completed in 2016. An activity on Energy Efficiency investments options followed. These were trust funded from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). Currently the WBG is supporting the development of the Renewable Energy Roadmap.The WBG’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), also scaled up its support to Botswana.IFC Kgalagadi Bond ($25 million): In late 2017, IFC became the first non-resident entity to issue AAA-rated local currency debt in Botswana. The Bond met with strong demand leveraging approximately 258 million Pula to promote financial inclusion through the Botswana Building Society (BBS). The Bond’s long-term financing will also support the transformation of BBS into a full-service, commercial bank financing underserved market segments, including SMEs.Public-Private Partnership (PPP) support in the water sector ($1.55 million): In early 2019, Botswana’s Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) contracted IFC to provide PPP advisory support to the Glen Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant.In addition, past projects have contributed to Botswana’s development in the following areas:The Botswana National HIV/AIDS Prevention Project ($50 million): The WBG brought global and regional experience to increase the efficiency of the national HIV/AIDS program by supporting the government to transition from an “emergency” response to a broader, more strategic and sustainable approach. The Botswana National HIV/AIDS Prevention Project closed in March 2015. The WBG leveraged a contribution of $20 million from the European Commission using an innovative, performance-based “buy-down” structure to improve the performance of the National AIDS Coordinating Agency.Morupule B Generation and Transmission Project ($66 million): To support Botswana in developing reliable and affordable supply of electricity for energy security and promoting alternative energy resources for low-carbon growth, including building capacity in the energy sector.

        CONTEXTBotswana is located at the center of Southern Africa, positioned between South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. One of the world’s poorest countries at independence in 1966, it rapidly became one of the world’s development success stories. Significant mineral (diamond) wealth, good governance, prudent economic management and a relatively small population of slightly more than two million, have made it an upper middle-income country with a transformation agenda of becoming a high-income country by 2036.Political ContextBotswana’s stable political environment includes a multi-party democratic tradition, with general elections held every five years. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has been in power since 1966. In October 23, 2019 Botswana held its 11th general elections, with His Excellency President Dr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi assuming the presidency. The new cabinet was announced on Nov 6, 2019 and Honorable Dr. Thapelo Matsheka was appointed the Minister of Finance and Economic Development.Economic OverviewBotswana has historically enjoyed strong and stable growth since independence, with sizable fiscal buffers and prudent policies playing a key role in shielding the economy. More recently, however, the limitations of Botswana’s diamond-led development model have become more apparent: growth is slower, inequality remains high and job creation is limited. At the same time, increased diamond market volatility—including growing competition from synthetic diamonds, reduced Southern African Customs Union transfers and fiscal expansion have resulted in eroded fiscal buffers.Botswana’s economy faces an unprecedented challenge due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, only a year after weakening global demand for diamonds and severe droughts led to a slowdown in growth to 3 percent in 2019 (from 4.5% in 2018). The economy is expected to contract by at least 9.1% in 2020 as COVID-19’s impact on global demand, travel restrictions and social distancing measures constrain output in key production and export sectors, including the diamond industry and tourism. Both external and fiscal pressures will become accentuated in 2020, with the overall deficit set to double (from 4% of GDP last year). Nevertheless, debt levels are set to likely remain below prudence levels.Developments in the global diamond industry will have a telling impact on the short-term recovery given Botswana’s dependence on the commodity. Whilst a mild recovery is expected for 2021, the economic impact of COVID-19 is likely to be deep and long-lasting. The authorities’ ability to advance on key reforms laid out in its 2020-2023 Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan will thus play a key role in creating conditions for broad-based growth and thus improving Botswana’s economic performance.Social ContextLiving conditions have improved for the Botswana people, and poverty has fallen significantly.

        Botswana joined the International Board for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association in 1968, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1979 and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1990. The IFC supports the competitiveness agenda through selective investment technical assistance interventions. MIGA also supports the country’s competitiveness agenda through the provision of political risk insurance, when it is needed by foreign investors active in the country.

The Government, in its partnership with the World Bank Group (WBG), is promoting policies to address the capacity gap between institutions and to improve service delivery.The WBG will continue to align its program with the Government’s priorities to create space for broader engagement where there is a potential for transformational impact. Key EngagementThe partnership with Bulgaria is characterized by knowledge and advisory services, provided through Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) arrangements and supported by EU funding.On September 1, 2015, Cyril Muller, the World Bank’s Vice President for Europe and Central Asia, and Tomislav Donchev, Bulgaria’s Deputy Prime Minister for EU Funds and Economic Policies, signed a second Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on partnership and support in the implementation of European Structural and Investment Funds for the 2014-20 period.The current Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Bulgaria, endorsed by the Board in May 2016, covers a period of six years to coincide with the EU programing cycle. The CPF marks a renewed engagement with Bulgaria, including the first new lending operation since FY11.The CPF Performance and Learning Review (PLR) reconfirmed the relevance of the program’s main areas of engagement, and implementation over the first two years is on track to achieve the program’s objectives.The new EU funding program for 2021–27, including the introduction of Enabling Conditions, will require the continued strengthening of the state and its institutions, an area in which the Bulgarian government has expressed interest in continued WBG support.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsIn early July 2020, Bulgaria joined the waiting room for the eurozone, the EU’s Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM-II), after the Government delivered on a list of prior commitments in the areas of banking and non-banking financial supervision, the governance of state-owned enterprises, and money laundering, among others. Thus far, the negative impact of the global COVID-19 crisis on the Bulgarian economy has been relatively mild compared to other EU members, thanks to its lower exposure to global value chains and foreign tourism. For 2020, the Bank forecasts a contraction of 5.1 percent of GDP. Job shedding, primarily in the hotel and restaurant, manufacturing, and trade sectors, has been mitigated by a salary subsidy program under which the Government is covering 60 percent of gross wages in distressed businesses. Average unemployment for 2020 is forecast to grow moderately by 1.8 percentage points to 6 percent year-on-year.Bulgaria entered the crisis in a strong fiscal position: public debt of 20 percent of GDP, a fiscal surplus as of end-March 2020, and a hefty fiscal reserve of some 9 percent of GDP. As of the end of August, the budget surplus had been retained at 1.3 percent of government-projected GDP. The year-to-date surplus was due to conservative revenue planning, the retention of expenditure, and the slow implementation of fiscal response measures - the latter of which were relatively limited in scale.A rapid worsening of the fiscal position is expected in the reminder of the year, however.  In mid-September, the country re-entered the international bond market for the first time since 2016 and successfully placed €1.25 billion in 10-year bonds and €1.25 billion in 30-year bonds at average yields of 0.389 and 1.476 percent, respectively. Economic OutlookBoth private and public investment are likely to decline substantially in 2020, as private investors remain wary of the recovery prospects and public investment projects are postponed. EU funds for public investment under the anti-crisis Recovery and Resilience Facility are to start being absorbed no earlier than 2021.Thanks to a good starting position, the fiscal deficit in 2020 will remain relatively contained at 4.1 percent of GDP, which will increase public debt to 27.7 percent of GDP. The COVID-19 crisis has exposed the dual need for reform and investment in key public spheres, such as health and education. Unless reform efforts are urgently directed at these and other public sectors, the latter will be increasingly unable to provide services that are up to expected standards.Poverty at the US$5.5 per day line is expected to increase between 2019 and 2020, reversing a previous trend of sustained, albeit slowing, decreases in poverty since 2016. The recovery in the labor market is likely to be uneven, with a lengthier recovery for individuals in less secure jobs.The slow uptake of the Government’s proposed fiscal package to retain and hire employees and provide support to individuals in non-standard work contracts is likely to further prolong the recovery. Similarly, individuals in vulnerable households may not readily see incomes returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, which will be compounded by concerns surrounding the coverage and adequacy of existing social security systems and the limited uptake of new social measures.Risks to the outlook continue to stem primarily from the uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic and its development, both domestically and globally.

        Djibouti is one of the smallest countries in Africa, with an area of 23,200 square kilometers and a population estimated at about 990,000. The size of its economy limits its ability to diversify production and increases its reliance on foreign markets, making it more vulnerable to market downturns and hampering its access to external capital. With less than 1,000 square kilometers of arable land (0.04% of its total land area) and average annual rainfall of only 130 millimeters, Djibouti depends almost completely on imports to meet its food needs. Djibouti’s strength lies in its strategic location at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, marking a bridge between Africa and the Middle East. Adjacent to some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes (between Asia and Europe), it hosts military bases for France, the United States, Japan, China, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as for other countries with forces supporting global anti-piracy efforts. Djibouti’s US$2 billion city-state economy is driven by a state-of-the-art port complex, among the most sophisticated in the world. Trade through the port is expected to grow rapidly in parallel with the expanding economy of the country’s largest neighbor and main trading partner, Ethiopia. Djibouti has some natural assets that could be used for tourism, as well as untapped marine resources that could support more artisanal fishing, and an infrastructure of undersea telecommunications cables from which it could develop new digital and service industries. Renewable energy could be another source of growth, as Djibouti has geothermal, solar, and eolian potential. Djibouti’s economic activity contracted in 2020 for the first time in two decades as a result of COVID-19. Lockdown measures and the suspension of international travel severely hit construction, general trade, air and urban transportation, and services. A resurgence of the pandemic, political instability, and the vulnerability of the Horn of Africa to natural disasters, such as desert locusts, would undermine the productivity of sizable infrastructure investment. The medium-term economic outlook remains positive despite the impact of COVID-19: Growth is expected to average 7.1% per year in 2021–2022, driven by a rebound in Ethiopia, which will underpin free zone reexports and exports of transportation, logistics, and telecommunication services. Ongoing infrastructure projects are also expected to boost growth.

        The upcoming World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Framework (CPF) will build upon the Djibouti CPS Performance and Learning Review. Approved by the Bank’s Board in May 2016, this supports Djibouti’s Vision 2035 strategy to reduce extreme poverty and build the foundations for shared growth by harnessing the country’s human and economic potential. The new CPF is expected to be issued in 2021 and will deepen the Bank’s engagement with Djibouti in job creation, human capital development, and state capacity building. As of October 2020, Djibouti’s active portfolio comprises 14 IDA projects worth a total of US$209 million. Bank teams have been able to leverage IDA resources through recipient-executed Trust Funds, with a net commitment value of about $8.4 million. (Trust Fund activities are aligned with the IDA-funded portfolio.) The portfolio is focused on education, health, social safety nets, energy, rural community development, urban poverty reduction, the modernization of public administration, governance, and private sector development, with emphasis on women and youth.Specific results include:27,567 households—nearly 154,000 people—received food vouchers, and another 4,888 households—or about 29,000 people—received cash transfers during the first COVID-19 outbreak and ensuing lockdown.97,000 beneficiaries (both nationals and refugees in the Ali Sabieh and Obock regions) benefited from improved access to social and economic services, and infrastructure.10,000 beneficiaries in Holl Holl town accessed electricity through the extension of the main grid to villages.1,000 beneficiaries in five poor neighborhoods in Obock received an individual electricity connection. 667 beneficiaries benefited from livelihood program activities, including 328 women and 339 youth. Beneficiaries have received extensive training and livelihood support, including livelihoods’ grants.Over 300,000 beneficiaries received quality health care services; more than 90,000 women received two to four prenatal visits.Last Updated: Oct 01, 2020"

        Integrated cash transfer and human capital developmentThe ongoing integrated cash transfer and human capital development (PITCH) project enabled the rapid deployment of cash and in-kind transfers during the first wave of the pandemic in early to mid-2020 and its ensuing lockdown: 27,567 poor and vulnerable households—nearly 154,000 people—living in Djibouti city and Balballa, each received food vouchers worth 30,000FD ($170) over three months. At the same time, cash transfers to 12,300 households in rural and urban areas have continued, of which 4,888 were financed by the Bank. PITCH has also launched accompanying measures for cash transfer beneficiaries to boost human capital development: These include information sessions on key themes, such as nutrition, education, health, and gender-based violence—as well as medical care, provided on the spot at the time of quarterly cash transfer payments through a partnership with the Ministry of Health.The project is helping the Government continue the development of a national, social registry, which serves as the gateway to nine different social programs, including subsidized health insurance, social housing, food assistance, and cash transfers. The social registry now contains data on 73,281 households, over 1/3 of the population. PITCH is assisting the Government to realize its goal of including refugees in the social registry, so that their eligibility for social programs can be determined—to date, 661 refugee households have been added to the registry under PITCH, with an end of project goal of 1,500.Finally, the project is putting in place a new community-driven development program that aims to boost access to human capital-related infrastructure in the interior of the country. So that communities can be empowered to identify and execute their sub-projects, a community training program is being developed through a knowledge exchange process with Beninese and Senegalese experts. Sub-project execution is expected to begin in several months in 50 selected sites. The program is being implemented in partnership with Djibouti’s Secretariat of State for Decentralization, regional authorities, and Djibouti Agency for Social Development (ADDS) to promote the greater decentralization of government functions in a highly participatory and transparent manner. Development Response to Displacement in the Horn of Africa ProjectInterventions by the Regional Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (DRDIP) have improved access to social and economic services and infrastructure for 97,000 beneficiaries (both nationals and refugees in the Ali Sabieh and Obock regions); of the 33,000 host community beneficiaries, 65% are women. More than 1,300 beneficiaries of economic development activities have reported an increase in income.A concrete example is the extension of main grid lines of the national electricity network to Holl Holl town to benefit over 2,700 households (more than 10,000 beneficiaries). The 100 newly installed public lights are testimony to the realization of a 40-year wait for the residents. About 356 houses, 24 village shops, and a range of public facilities, such as the town’s health center, primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools and community development center, are benefiting from the individual connections that are currently being established. Major investments include the newly rehabilitated and renovated health center in Ali Addeh, Djibouti, that is serving both refugees and host communities in equal proportion with high-quality health care services. The center is well-staffed and equipped with hospital beds, X-ray machine, and surgery equipment, in clean premises with well-lit wards.Improving Health Sector Performance projectThe ongoing Improving Health Sector Performance project has increased the use of quality health care services for maternal and child health. So far, over 300,000 beneficiaries have received quality health care services; more than 90,000 women have received two to four prenatal visits; and 85% of children have been fully immunized before their first birthday. Five primary level community health centers have been upgraded to secondary level polyclinics providing 24-hour emergency and delivery care and outpatient services for a population of close to 100,000.

        Thanks to the boom in oil prices between 2004 and 2014, Ecuador experienced a period of growth and poverty reduction. Nevertheless, the 2014 decline in oil prices revealed the country’s lack of macroeconomic cushions and limited private investment.In the absence of fiscal savings, Ecuador has attempted to adapt its economy to a challenging global context with support from international organizations, including the World Bank Group. In this context, the country is promoting a reform program to ensure fiscal sustainability, strengthen the foundations of dollarization, encourage private investment and guarantee social protection for the most vulnerable groups.The discussion and implementation of these reforms have faced some challenges, however, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices. These last two shocks will trigger a significant economic downturn and an increase in poverty, despite government efforts to reprioritize public spending and mobilize external financing to respond to the health emergency and protect the most vulnerable groups.In this context, it is crucial to maintain coordinated efforts to save lives, contain the economic and social costs of the Covid-19 crisis and establish the foundations for a rapid, effective recovery.Fiscal consolidation and private sector development are pivotal for achieving macroeconomic stability. It is necessary to maintain and create new job opportunities to reduce poverty and make families more resilient to external and natural disaster shocks. Additionally, safeguarding social protection mechanisms is indispensable for the most vulnerable sectors.

        On June 11, 2019, the World Bank Board of Directors approved the 2019-2023 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) with Ecuador. This document establishesa funding and technical assistance program to support the country’s development and growth efforts.Prepared with the Government of Ecuador and taking into account consultations with different civil society and private sector groups, the CPF addresses the need to support macroeconomic stabilization, protect the most vulnerable sectors and reactivate sustainable growth. To this end, the CPF prioritizes three work areas:Supporting fundamentals for inclusive growth;Boosting human capital development and protecting vulnerable populations; andEnhancing institutional and environmental sustainability.Each area has results indicators. To achieve them, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC, a WBG institution that supports the private sector) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA, a WBG institution that offers insurance against political and investment risks) will collaborate to increase impact.The work areas and objectives established in the 2019-2023 CPF are interrelated and complementary. Developing a human capital with skills adapted to labor market needs, coupled with policies based on evidence and recent information, will drive inclusive growth as well as improve the country’s resilience to disasters and macroeconomic shocks.Additionally, more efficient spending and the adoption of international transparency standards in public management will contribute to the sustainability and protection of social services. The simultaneous progress in the two first areas will facilitate the country’s access to financial markets and will establish the foundations for strengthening institutions as the country advances down its road to development. Nine investment projects comprise the current portfolio, which totals USD 1.628 billion. These projects focus on increasing access to better quality services and to improving infrastructure in transportation, water, sanitationand education, as well as making the social protection and public health systems more effective.Projects currently being designed will be submitted to the World Bank’s Board of Directors before June 30, 2020. These total USD 800 million and focus on macroeconomic policies and improving the social and financial inclusion of vulnerable populations.In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Bank is supporting the government to strengthen its public healthcare system, protect the most vulnerable population and create alternatives that enable the injection of liquidity and economic recovery.Through the technical assistance program, the World Bank finances studies on key aspects of development, including: (i) spending efficiency, (ii) transparency of production sectors, (iii) the labor market; and (iv) human capital development.

        Thanks to the boom in oil prices between 2004 and 2014, Ecuador experienced a period of growth and poverty reduction. Nevertheless, the 2014 decline in oil prices revealed the country’s lack of macroeconomic cushions and limited private investment.In the absence of fiscal savings, Ecuador has attempted to adapt its economy to a challenging global context with support from international organizations, including the World Bank Group. In this context, the country is promoting a reform program to ensure fiscal sustainability, strengthen the foundations of dollarization, encourage private investment and guarantee social protection for the most vulnerable groups.The discussion and implementation of these reforms have faced some challenges, however, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices. These last two shocks will trigger a significant economic downturn and an increase in poverty, despite government efforts to reprioritize public spending and mobilize external financing to respond to the health emergency and protect the most vulnerable groups.In this context, it is crucial to maintain coordinated efforts to save lives, contain the economic and social costs of the Covid-19 crisis and establish the foundations for a rapid, effective recovery.Fiscal consolidation and private sector development are pivotal for achieving macroeconomic stability. It is necessary to maintain and create new job opportunities to reduce poverty and make families more resilient to external and natural disaster shocks. Additionally, safeguarding social protection mechanisms is indispensable for the most vulnerable sectors.

        Strengthening of shared prosperityResults achieved in the Country Partnership FrameworkThe World Bank Group and the Government of Ecuador resumed dialogue in 2014. The World Bank prepares analytical studies and lending operations in specific areas in the country. It also prioritizes investments in strategic sectors for development, such as education, transportation, water and sanitation. The analytical studies focus on improving social services and legal frameworks and providing evidence-based information in key areas to continue efforts to reduce poverty and inequalities.Increased access to better quality services in education and social protectionTrust funds financed several advisory and technical assistance services in areas such as combating malnutrition, inclusion of disabled persons and improving the efficiency of the social protection system. Additionally, with a view to building the country’s capacity to produce timely, relevant data for decision-making, the World Bank, together with the National Statistics and Census Institute  (INEC) and SENPLADES, prepared The Poverty Report, 2006 – 2014 and the Poverty and Consumption Inequality Map  2014.Integration of reforms in water supply, sanitation, transportation and risk managementIn 2016, the World Bank published a poverty assessment associated with water and sanitation services. To this end, it provided technical assistance to the National Statistics and Census Institute to publish water, sanitation and hygiene indicators for the first time in Ecuador.With respect to transportation, the World Bank mobilized resources to build institutional capacities at the national and sub-national levels to compile and produce statistics on traffic accidents through the National Transit Agency.It also supported the National Risk Management Secretariat to develop a national disaster response strategy and a methodology to create sector programs in disaster risk management that address a variety of dangers and risks.Investment projects in EcuadorFrom July 2013 to June 2015, the World Bank portfolio included three operations (USD 407.5 million) requested by the sub-national governments of Manta, Quito and Guayaquil. In 2016, the Bank approved another operation for the Ibarra government[1] (USD 52.5 million). These operations cover the sectors of transportation, water and sanitation. The World Bank expanded its participation in the agricultural sector[2] to improve incomes of small- and medium-holder farmers through support to the more productive, efficient use of land and water from a climate perspective.  In 2016, it approved an investment operation to raise enrolment and permanence of students in public technical and technological institutes designed and implemented in collaboration with employers, and to strengthen institutional management of technical and technological tertiary education (USD 90.5 million). The World Bank also mobilized an emergency response loan (USD 150 million) to provide aid following the earthquake that affected Ecuador in April 2016. World Bank support focused on reconstruction while other multilateral development banks, such as IDB and CAF, provided support for the initial recovery and immediate response, together with United Nations agencies.-------[1] Transport Infrastructure Project in Ibarra, Ecuador (P147280) to improve mobility of Ibarra and the use of recreational spaces around Yahuarcocha Lagoon.[2] Project to Modernize Sustainable Family Agriculture in Ecuador (P151963).

        The country’s main development challenge lies in transforming its oil producing economy into a more diversified one. The main challenge facing the authorities is to restore macroeconomic stability. Fiscal buffers, including the Bank of Central African States’ (BEAC) international reserves, have declined rapidly.Given the Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries’ commitment to maintaining the currency peg, the burden of the adjustment will fall on fiscal policy. Successful fiscal consolidation, non-accumulation of new arrears, and reduction in off-budget spending will be critical to restore macroeconomic sustainability and avoid a disorderly adjustment.

        Equatorial Guinea, also referred to as EQG, is the only former Spanish colony in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is composed of a mainland, Rio Muni, and small islands including Bioko where the capital Malabo is located, Annobon, Corisco, Elobey, and others. According to a 2015 population census, the population is 1.2 million people. The country is bordered in the north by Cameroon, in the east and south by Gabon, and to the west by the Gulf of Guinea. It is well endowed with arable land and mineral resources ranging from gold, oil, uranium, diamond, and columbite-tantalite, and notably petroleum discovered in the 1990s.Political OverviewPresident Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has served for 39 years, making him the longest-serving head of state in Sub-Saharan Africa. His position was bolstered by his landslide victory in the last presidential election in November 2009. The absence of real checks and balances grants his political party, the Partido democratico de Guinea Ecuatorial (PDGE), absolute executive power. The country’s constitution was amended following the November 2011 referendum and a new government was appointed in May 2012. The legislative, senatorial and municipal elections were held in May 2013 and confirmed the domination of the ruling party, PDGE. However, legalized opposition parties continue to voice their discontent over the country’s governance but their capacity to influence policy is limited.After a government reshuffle in 2017, M. Nchama, former governor of the Bank of Central African States, was appointed the new minister of Economy and Planning. While still fragile, the socio-political situation remains stable.  Economic OverviewThe country has been one of the fastest growing economies in Africa in the past decade. After the discovery of large oil reserves in the 1990s, Equatorial Guinea became the third-largest producer of oil in Sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria and Angola. More recently, substantial gas reserves have also been discovered. However, the country macroeconomic and fiscal situation has deteriorated following the oil price drop.EQG experienced the full extent of the Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) crisis because of its large dependence on oil exports and lack of sufficient buffers, such as government deposits and international reserves and while it has announced plans for adjustment is has not yet reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The government’s development agenda is guided by a medium-term strategy paper, the National Economic Development Plan: Horizon 2020, which targets economic diversification and poverty reduction. The first phase of Horizon 2020 focused on infrastructure development was concluded in 2012. The second phase will focus on economic diversification, targeting strategic new sectors such as fisheries, agriculture, tourism and finance.As the country moves into the second phase of the National Development Plan, the government is planning to redirect public investment from infrastructure towards the development of new economic sectors. Equatorial Guinea is largely dependent on oil. The significant economic impact of the recent drop in international oil prices has underscored the importance of promoting non-oil growth and increasing efficiency of spending.Equatorial Guinea is among the countries worst hit by the Central African Economic Monetary Community (CEMAC) crisis which started in 2014, facing twin deficits and a rapid loss of international reserves stemming from dependence on oil exports, lack of sufficient buffers, and weak public financial management (PFM) procedures.To restore its external and fiscal imbalances, Equatorial Guinea is undertaking several reforms and has entered into an IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in May 2018. The reforms include raising non-hydrocarbon tax revenues and reducing the non-hydrocarbon primary deficit, improving PFM in coordination with the other CEMAC countries, supporting social sectors, protecting the banking sector through the non-accumulation of new arrears, and improving governance.EQG became member of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in May 2017. For the government, joining OPEC could be an attempt to bolster foreign investment and technology transfers from other member countries, especially from the Gulf.

The program is designed to ensure strong government ownership while enhancing the Bank’s contribution to the country’s development in a way that goes beyond funding. It works on a cost-sharing arrangement between the Bank and the Government to ensure relevance and ownership on both sides of the table. The areas of focus and scope of the economic research program are determined by the Government in consultation with the World Bank.The high-level brainstorming sessions, co-chaired by the prime minister, have become a highlight of the JERP. Since 2003, over 20 brainstorming sessions have provided direct input into the Government’s ambitious reform agenda. These forums make use of the Bank's technical expertise and international experience to build capacity in reform formulation and implementation. The notable comparative advantages that the Bank brings to the JERP include the ability to draw on a global network to find best practice examples and an outside neutrality that is critical to proposing changes and navigating political land mines.The JERP for FY21 amounts to roughly US$1.5 million and includes six activities, which, for the most part, are aimed at supporting the main priorities of Kazakhstan’s strategic development. In particular, the analytical work is focusing on (i) increasing productivity and support to industrial innovation and digital development; and (ii) developing a national monitoring and evaluation system for measuring results and linking the strategies and national plans to the budget.

        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS The COVID-19 pandemic and the precipitous fall in oil prices have been the double hits to the economy. GDP fell by 3.0 percent in January–August 2020, reflecting the stringency of the restrictions that depressed economic activity. Consumer demand is likely to have shrunk notably as retail trade fell by 11.7 percent. Investment dropped by 5.2 percent, while exports have fallen amid the weak global context. On the supply side, the contraction has been concentrated in the sectors most affected by the lockdown: hospitality, retail, travel, and leisure. Despite weakened exports, lower imports and the repatriation of profits helped to shift the current account into a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in the first half of the year. The surplus in the current account helped increase the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves to US$35.4 billion in August from US$29 billion in December 2019. Falling oil prices led the tenge to lose about 15 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in mid-March. However, following the pickup in oil prices and interventions by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the tenge regained a third of its earlier losses. The authorities swiftly responded to the pandemic with a fiscal stimulus, scaling up spending on social assistance and support to small and medium-sized enterprises. Budget spending increased by an estimated 5.3 percent of GDP to 26.7 percent in January–June. To make up for the non-oil revenue shortfall, Oil Fund reserves were deployed, which helped to limit the deficit increase. The deficit rose to 2.9 percent of GDP from a near balance a year earlier, whereas the non-oil deficit surged to 15.1 percent, reflecting the increasing reliance on oil revenues. Public debt moved slightly up to 22.1 percent of GDP.  Inflation rose to 7.0 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in August from 5.4 percent in December 2019, above the NBK’s 4–6 percent target range. Higher food prices, which grew by 10.9 percent in August y-o-y, contributed the most to the increase in inflation. Despite the higher inflation, concerns over declining economic activity led the NBK to cut its policy rate by 50 basis points to 9.0 percent in July. So far, the banking system is weathering the crisis relatively well, thanks to improved balance sheets after a series of earlier bailouts. Despite falling economic activity, banks sustained profits, due in part to active lending. Although growth in retail credit remained robust, corporate lending has begun to recover. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose to 9 percent in July from 8.1 percent in December 2019. However, higher insolvency risks, notably of micro and small businesses, after a slow resumption of activity, could further stress the banks’ loan portfolios and lead to higher NPLs. The pressure on the financial sector may further increase if firms’ leverage continues to rise while business prospects remain sluggish after the tax deferral measures expire and liquidity support is reduced. The official unemployment rate edged up to 5.0 percent in July from a pre-pandemic 4.8 percent, though the actual joblessness rate is likely much higher among self-employed and part-time workers. The crisis has likely disproportionally hurt the poor and the vulnerable as employment contraction amplifies the burden of falling incomes. The share of people living on less than US$5.5 a day is expected to increase to at least 8.5 percent in 2020 in the most optimistic scenario. However, if the impact on the population follows a similar pattern to previous downturns, poverty may rise to as much as 12.7 percent.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKConditional on the course of COVID-19, real GDP is projected to contract by 2.5 percent in 2020. The prospect of an economic recovery in 2021 is tempered by uncertainty over the pandemic, the global demand for oil, and structural challenges. Growth could recover to a point within the 2.0–3.0 percent range and return to its pre-pandemic level only by 2022, translating into a gradual reduction in the poverty rate. Inflationary pressure is expected to persist this year and abate gradually through 2021, remaining above the NBK’s target range. The current account is likely to move into a deficit in 2020, as the OPEC+ agreement on oil exports remains in force and imports begin to recover. The pressure on the external balance will diminish as exports and the price of oil gradually improve and the fiscal stimulus wanes. The authorities are targeting a narrower fiscal deficit in 2021, reflecting a recovery of the economy and the lapse of pandemic-related spending. Government debt is likely to rise to a still moderate 30 percent of GDP over the medium term but remain sustainable.

Since 2002, GDP per capita has risen sixfold and poverty incidence has fallen sharply, significantly improving the country’s performance on the World Bank’s indicator of shared prosperity. The global economic slowdown and internal structural weakness have challenged the sustainability of Kazakhstan’s growth model. Sluggish productivity growth, excessive state involvement in the economy, and increased dependence on commodities have been the main contributors to the weak economic performance. This year Kazakhstan is facing a sharp decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment and poverty, despite the substantial fiscal response. The COVID-19 pandemic has further reinforced the urgent need for reforms to reverse the declining growth capacity. To support a resilient and sustainable economic recovery, Kazakhstan needs to promote important reforms: First, diversifying the economic base by improving the competitiveness of its non-extractive sectors and continuing reforms in the financial sector Second, limiting the dominance of large state-owned enterprises in the economy, strengthening competition, and reducing the government role in deciding the allocation of resources, which distorts the environment for the private sectorThird, strengthening public sector institutions and reinforcing the rule of law to attract much-needed investment.","
        
        Project SpotlightFostering Productive Innovation in KazakhstanWhether it happens among students in a classroom or engineers in a laboratory, innovation is a process that begins with an idea and results in transformative trends and business start-ups that can boost a country’s economic development.  For Kazakhstan, innovation has the potential to unleash the private sector as the country strives to build a more diversified and competitive economy.Launched by the Kazakh Ministry of Education and Science and the World Bank, and building on the impressive achievements of the Bank’s Technology Commercialization Project over the past 12 years, the Fostering Productive Innovation Project (FPIP) promotes and develops commercial innovations in Kazakhstan by providing grants to entrepreneurs and start-ups seeking to improve the quality of people’s lives.The primary objective of the FPIP for Kazakhstan is to promote high-quality, nationally relevant research on, and the commercialization of, new technologies.Almagul Kakimzhanova“Such innovation grants designed to foster productive innovation financed by the Science Committee and the World Bank are in great need in Kazakhstan. They just change our thinking as scientists. This project changed our thinking into believing that any scientific development could be commercialized in order to bring benefits to people,” notes Almagul Kakimzhanova, a leading specialist in the molecular biology of plants and a successful recipient of one of the competitive innovation grants, “Greenlab,” provided under the FPIP.The projects that receive the inclusive innovation consortia grants are varied in their nature and application. “X-matrix,” which produces biological dressings with highly efficient healing properties for the treatment of burns and wounds based on an extracellular xenogenic matrix, is one of the many successful grantees. ReLive, a start-up company based at Nazarbaev University and another grantee, has developed a unique platform designed to rehabilitate patients after a stroke through groundbreaking artificial intelligence–supported neuro-rehabilitation robotic software. The United Nations has recognized the start-up’s invention as one of the world’s top 20 innovative solutions.The FPIP has helped to improve the quality of scientific research in Kazakhstan and its relevance to market needs, research and development spending, and collaboration between universities and industry.The project has also strengthened the capacity of key institutions of the National Innovation System by introducing market-oriented approaches to the selection and support of innovation projects and technology start-ups. Moreover, it has contributed significantly to the country’s ability to effectively collaborate in funding international-level research and development and in changing the mindset of the scientific community and policy makers to look more closely at Kazakhstan’s economic development through direct engagement and dialogue with the private sector._______________________________________All projects in Kazakhstan

        Last updated: April 2020Since gaining independence in 1957, Malaysia has successfully diversified its economy from one that was initially agriculture and commodity-based, to one that now plays host to robust manufacturing and service sectors, which have propelled the country to become a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts and components.Malaysia is one of the most open economies in the world with a trade to GDP ratio averaging over 130% since 2010. Openness to trade and investment has been instrumental in employment creation and income growth, with about 40% of jobs in Malaysia linked to export activities. After the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, Malaysia’s economy has been on an upward trajectory, averaging growth of 5.4% since 2010, and is expected to achieve its transition from an upper middle-income economy to a high-income economy by 2024.However, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has had a major economic impact on Malaysia, particularly on its vulnerable households. With less than 1% of Malaysian households living in extreme poverty (according to the official national poverty line), the government’s focus has shifted toward addressing the well-being of the poorest 40% of the population (“the bottom 40”). This low-income group remains particularly vulnerable to economic shocks as well as increases in the cost of living and mounting financial obligations.Income inequality in Malaysia remains high relative to other East Asian countries but is gradually declining. While income growth for the bottom 40 has outpaced the top 60 over much of the last decade, the absolute gap across income groups has increased, contributing to widespread perceptions of the poor being “left behind.” Following the removal of broad-based subsidies, the government has gradually moved toward more targeted measures to support the poor and vulnerable, mainly in the form of cash transfers to low-income households.Malaysia’s near-term economic outlook will be more dependent than usual on government measures to sustain private sector activity as the shock of COVID-19 reduces export-led growth, and as a depleted fiscal space limits public investment-led expansion. Over the longer term, as Malaysia converges with high-income economies, incremental growth will depend less on factor accumulation and more on raising productivity to sustain higher potential growth. While significant, Malaysia’s productivity growth over the past 25 years has been below that of several global and regional comparators. Ongoing reform efforts to tackle key structural constraints will be vital to support and sustain Malaysia’s development path.According to the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, Malaysia ranks 55th out of 157 countries. To fully realize its human potential and fulfil the country’s aspiration of achieving the high-income and developed country status, Malaysia will need to advance further in education, health and nutrition, and social protection outcomes. Key priority areas include enhancing the quality of schooling to improve learning outcomes, rethinking nutritional interventions to reduce childhood stunting, and providing adequate social welfare protection for household investments in human capital formation.

        Nicaragua’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPF) for 2018-2022 was built based on a Systematic Country Diagnosis and aims to further address poverty reduction while promoting prosperity for more Nicaraguans.The Nicaragua CPF is based on three vital objectives:    1. Investing in human capital, in particular for disadvantaged groups.     2. Enabling private investment for job creation.    3. Strengthening public institutions to improve disaster and external economic crises risk management.The CPF prioritizes programs to expand coverage and quality of preschool, primary and secondary education; improve maternal and child health; and expand access to water and sanitation services. It also seeks landholding, renewable energy and infrastructure improvement, increased productivity, exports diversification, and trade facilitation.This plan focuses on both investing in the human capital of Nicaraguans, health, education and skills, and on the private sector to create better paying jobs. It highlights working with young people, women, Indigenous populations, people of African descent, and in territories such as the dry belt and the Caribbean regions.The work program for 2018-2022 comprises interest-free credits and donations from the International Development Association (IDA) for investment projects, South-South exchanges, technical assistance, and analytical work.Additionally, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group private-sector arm, plays a lead financing role in the agribusiness and financial sectors, while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is open to opportunities to support foreign direct investment in the renewable power generation, agribusiness and financial sectors through the provision of risk guarantees.As of October 2020, the World Bank portfolio in Nicaragua includes 6 projects, totaling US$328.90 million in net commitments, in the areas of (1) roads, telecommunications and land administration; (2) education and health; (3) and catastrophic insurance. No new lending has been approved by the World Bank for the public sector since the beginning of the political crisis in April 2018. As with all Bank projects, the decision to propose operations is contingent on the appropriate conditions being in place for the effective implementation of activities to benefit the people of Nicaragua.Given the current health emergency, the World Bank is ready to collaborate with the Government finding solutions to the most pressing needs, either by formulating a new project or by the activation of emergency components from projects currently under operation.  In whatever form of aid is implemented, it will be ensured that all fiduciary requirements are in place so that resources are used for the established purposes.

        Between 2012 and 2018, with the Second Educational Sector Support Project (PASEN II), an International Development Association (IDA) financed project, around 230,000 primary students of the poorest regions of the country, representing 25 % of the national enrollment in primary education, received math, language, and literature textbooks, and almost 2,400 schools were equipped with new furniture.  Students from the autonomous regions in the Caribbean received 81,500 bilingual and monolingual textbooks in local languages. Also, more than 427,000 students received backpacks stocked with school supplies and shoes, which was recognized by parents as an incentive to keep their children in school.Since 2017 and as a follow up to PASEN II, the Project “Alliance for the Quality of Education” (ACE) has been improving pedagogical practices of teachers and educators nationwide at preschool, primary and secondary levels. It has also been improving the conditions of school environments for learning in selected schools; and strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Education for project management, monitoring and evaluation. There have been important achievements, such as the implementation of a Teacher Mentoring Program for primary and secondary school teachers, including the training of more than 500 school directors and deputy-directors, and the effective mentoring of more than 1250 teachers; in-service training for primary and preschool teachers with more than 9000 preschool teachers participating. The project also provided materials and equipment for teachers and students. In addition, it is planned to build more than 40 schools in prioritized municipalities of Nicaragua, of which several are under construction. All activities are carried out respecting and strengthening the multicultural nature of Nicaragua: Relevant activity documents and school material have been translated into indigenous languages and participatory decision-making mechanisms have been put in place.The Nicaragua Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project enables access to an efficient sovereign risk insurance associated with natural events, such as tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and excess rainfall. The government of Nicaragua renewed its earthquake, tropical cyclone and excess rainfall policies for 2019/20. This was Nicaragua’s fifth renewal of Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policies. The sovereign insurance offered by CCRIF Segregated Portfolio Company (SPC) is currently one of the main disaster risk financing instruments that Nicaragua has in place to provide short term liquidity in the case of a disaster, enabling the country to respond to the disaster until other funding can be mobilized. Under the insurance policies, CCRIF SPC has made two payouts to Nicaragua, including one on June 23, 2016 following a magnitude 6.1 earthquake; and another on December 2016 following Hurricane Otto.In terms of water and sanitation, the Sustainable Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Sector Project (PROSASR) provided water and sanitation systems to some 70 rural communities. From 2014 to 2019, 29,907 beneficiaries gained access to improved water supply and 13,980 people to safe sanitation services. The project not only financed civil works but also helped Nicaragua strengthen municipal and community capacities for the administration, operation and sustainable maintenance of water and sanitation systems in rural areas. The Project also supported the implementation of social programs to spread the benefits of proper hygiene and practices for water conservation, through a range of social learning techniques, including community theaters.The Second Land Administration Project (PRODEP II) covered six of the 15 Departments in the country, and helped develop better property rights regulations benefitting more than 805,946 people, more than half of which are women. From 2013 to June 2020, cadastral information for about 168,005 parcels was updated, and more than 110,000 families received legal documents for their properties, of which more than 82,000 are new land titles. All five protected areas within the project were demarcated, labeled and geo-referenced.From 2015 to 2019, the Nicaragua Caribbean Coast Food Security Project (PAIPSAN for its acronym in Spanish), financed by a grant of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), helped 14,826 beneficiaries (47% - 6,983 are women; 33% - 4,839 are youth; 4,136 are indigenous and 791 are afro descendants) and their families (85,812 people) in more than 500 rural communities of 15 municipalities to improve their availability and access to more nutritious food. Implementing a Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture approach, PAIPSAN brought agricultural and artisanal fishery innovations, nutrition training, good socio-environmental practices, as well as investments to increase value-addition and commercialization to improve family agriculture practices by indigenous, afro descendent and mestizo communities. On average, the project achieved 78.25% increase of agricultural yields, while more than 8000 protagonists adopted one or more agricultural and fishery technologies promoted by the project. 91.4% of women and children in protagonist families improved their Dietary Diversity Index by consuming 7 or more groups of food with high nutritional value.From 2017 to date, the Caribbean Regional Communications Infrastructure Program - Nicaragua (CARCIP) has promoted access to 3G cellular mobile phone services, including broadband Internet access at speeds above 2Mbps in 16 communities of the Caribbean Coast and Río San Juan, benefiting 39,518 inhabitants. A total of 450 inhabitants of these communities benefited from the digital literacy campaign which was carried out in Spanish, Mayangna and Miskito. In addition, with the aim of strengthening digital human talent and digital innovation, the project awarded 1,747 scholarships in English, 910 scholarships in soft skills and 52 scholarships in technical skills related to the information technology industry. Finally, the project enabled two open innovation centers in the Caribbean Coast (Puerto Cabezas and Bluefields) where young university students, with the help of mentors and following an open innovation methodology, developed 9 applications. Progress can also be seen in digital innovation centers for the cities of Bonanza, Siuna, León, and Granada.From 2010 to August 2020, through the Public Financial Management Modernization Project, IDA showed results in strengthening the country’s financial management capacities: 100 % of Central Government agencies adopted the multi-year and results-based budgeting methodologies. The Administrative and Financial Management Information System –SIGAF– was implemented in all Central Government agencies. In addition, statistics management capacity in preparation for the Population and Housing Census improved: Nicaragua now has an updated and redesigned digital cartography for statistical operations in all the municipalities. The Building Census was carried out in 2017 and progress was made in the development of a technological platform for the collection and processing of Census data. The technology of using Mobile Capture Devices in the Census was tested in pilot exercises.Since 2015 and 2018, respectively, through the projects Strengthening the Public Health Care System  and Integrated Public Provision of Health Care Services, the World Bank supports the institutionalization of plans to improve the quality of health care in Nicaragua and the prevention of chronic diseases in the first level of care. The dynamic is participatory and encourages municipalities to prepare health improvement plans. This is echoed, for example, in the training of 2,518 health workers, the creation and equipping of entomology rooms for the prevention of diseases transmitted by mosquito bites; in the establishment of hospital waste management plans in 34 of the 64 hospitals; in the creation of a wastewater evaluation system; in an increase in the percentages of women receiving prenatal care (>80%), in the scope of coverage of childhood vaccination (>85%), and institutional delivery (> 88%). 95% of the municipalities report compliance with these plans, over 50% of what was proposed.Through the Project for the Adaptation of Nicaragua's Water Supplies to Climate Change (PACCAS), between 2012 and 2018 guaranteed access to water, protection of water resources, and mitigation of climate impacts in several communities vulnerable to the effects of climate change in rural was pursued. For example, in the Corn Islands, off the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, the project resulted in the delimitation of 26 wetlands, which cover an area of protection of 150 ha and represent water reservoirs for the lives of 8,000 people living in the island; 26.6 ha of wetlands were reforested; two environmental and climate monitoring stations are up and running, which have strengthened the monitoring of climate and sea level behavior on the islands; and an environmental education and awareness plan was implemented to keeping the wetlands clean, protected and preserved as sources of life. A participation of 6,702 beneficiaries was achieved, of which 64 % are females.

Household consumption, fueled by increases in budgetary expenditures, a tight labor market, and rising wages, continued to grow.This, together with continuing low interest rates and the execution of European funds–related investments, helped Poland’s economic growth prospects.In the short-term, however, the main challenge is to mitigate the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the full impact of the virus remains uncertain, a prolonged outbreak would significantly curb economic activity, strain the health care system, affect supply chains, and depress investor sentiment and consumer demand, ultimately impacting the supply side and leading to a deeper recession.Under such a downside scenario, the economic and fiscal impact in 2020 would be more severe, with implications for jobs and poverty. On the positive side, Poland has the fiscal and monetary space to mitigate the adverse effects of lower global and domestic demand and shield its financially vulnerable populations, potentially leading to a quicker rebound in 2021 and 2022.The main medium-term challenge to sustained growth is a tightening labor supply exacerbated by an aging population.

        StrategyIBRD Lending2 Loans (US$688 million)Reimbursable Advisory Services2 (US$1.47 million)Trust Fund-Financed Advisory Services and Analytics 6 (US$3.83 million)Since the 1990s, the World Bank has been one of the most prominent development institutions in Poland, providing a total of US$16 billion in loans and helping introduce a number of key policy reforms. Poland’s relationship with the Bank is based on the recognition that the Bank’s presence in the country continues to generate value added for both sides: for Poland through access to financial and knowledge services in critical areas, and for the World Bank through a strengthened relationship with a high-income country that can bring development lessons to other countries around the world. The World Bank Group’s new Country Partnership Framework for Poland concentrates the Group’s engagement on key remaining development problems, including the health care system, environmental threats, and regional convergence.KEY ENGAGEMENTDespite significant efforts to reduce harmful air emissions during and after the economic transition in the 1990s, Poland remains home to many of the most polluted cities in the EU. Tens of thousands of people die prematurely every year because of smog. The economic costs associated with disease and premature death from exposure to ambient, small particulate matter (PM2.5) could be as high as US$40 billion a year.Aware of these problems, as well as of the growing pressure from civil society, the Polish Government has begun taking steps to improve air quality. The World Bank has been supporting these efforts and advising Poland in the implementation of financial mechanisms to launch a national program for anti-smog and energy efficiency.The already established Clean Air Program will reach the roughly 4.5 million single family buildings that are now primarily responsible for the smog and that need to replace their heating sources and carry out a thermal retrofitting. After two years of advisory help provided to Poland and upon the request of the Polish Government, the World Bank is now preparing a Program-for-Results operation to further support reforms in that critical area.In addition to the expected improvement of health outcomes in the society, the Clean Air Program may also become a driving force for the Polish economy, especially as the immediate COVID-19 crisis subsides, due to the sheer magnitude of the huge financial resources needed for its implementation and the associated creation of jobs related to insulating buildings and replacing heating systems.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsPoland’s GDP grew by 4.1 percent in 2019, driven primarily by domestic consumption and robust investment. Rising employment, higher wages, generous social transfers through the “Family 500+” and “13th Pension” programs, and favorable financing conditions have supported private consumption.Notwithstanding the freezing of energy prices for households and micro and small enterprises at mid-2018 levels, inflation accelerated to 4.7 percent year-on-year in February 2020.Above-potential GDP growth since 2017 helped to narrow the general government deficit, despite higher social transfers.Due to a pre-election fiscal stimulus, the general government deficit in 2019 is expected to increase to 1.7 percent of GDP, even as tax revenues exceeded expectations. The primary balance surplus, together with fast economic growth, helped to reduce public debt to 47.4 percent of GDP in 2019.Average household income rose by 4.3 percent in 2018, although the scale of the change was more limited than in 2017. Although income gains were registered for most households, the bottom 10 percent of the income distribution saw their incomes fall.A decline in incomes was also seen among farmers, whose harvests were affected by a severe drought in 2018. This fed in to higher national poverty rates in 2018 than in 2017.Economic OutlookWith the global outbreak of COVID-19, growth is expected to decelerate sharply to 0.4 percent in 2020, amid dramatically lower external demand, a temporary border lockdown, and far-reaching containment and avoidance measures, including the closing of many non-essential businesses, educational institutions, and cultural centers and a temporary border lockdown.Localized outbreaks are expected to be contained by June, with growth recovering to 2.2 and 2.9 percent in 2021 and 2022, respectively.The Government has announced measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and proposed an economic package that includes fiscal spending (roughly 3 percent of GDP) and a liquidity component (of approximately 3.3 percent), backed by €7.4 billion in funding from the European Commission and monetary easing started by the central bank.These efforts are aimed at supporting both the supply and demand sides of the economy by aiding affected companies’ liquidity and introducing tax relief and deferrals as well as a partial coverage of salaries in heavily impacted firms to sustain employment.The general government deficit is expected to widen in 2020. Although social assistance would continue to protect the poorest households, poor working households will be financially vulnerable to a reduction in the number of hours worked and job losses due to COVID-19 and to the potentially deteriorating economic climate.

        PROJECT SPOTLIGHTOdra-Vistula Flood Management ProjectThe World Bank has been partnering with Poland to strengthen the national flood protection system and secure the lives, health, and property of citizens since 1997, when the devastating “Millennium Floods” struck the country. This natural disaster reminded Poland of its intrinsic vulnerability to flooding caused by the mountainous and hilly landscape and by decades of neglect. In 20 years, thanks to World Bank support, a considerable stretch of the Odra River has been secured, while Wroclaw, one-third of which was flooded in 1997, today is a vibrant European city. After significant investments along the Odra River, the Government shifted its attention to Poland’s longest river, the Vistula, where the needs are still high. In 2015, the Government launched the Odra-Vistula Flood Management Project. Its development objective is to increase access to flood protection for people living in selected areas of the Odra and the Upper Vistula river basins and to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Government to mitigate flood events more effectively. The total project costs are US$1.317 million, with World Bank financing amounting to US$504 million. The project implementation period is eight years. Subsequent contracts for civil works and technical assistance are being signed and are currently under implementation.

        StrategyThe Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2016-20 for Azerbaijan aims to support the country on its path to sustainable, inclusive, and private sector-led growth.The CPF is underpinned by the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Azerbaijan, the World Bank Group’s (WBG) comprehensive analysis of the country’s economic conditions, challenges, and constraints in the short and longer term.Currently, the CPF is undergoing a mid-term review that, among other outcomes, will identify new areas for partnership with the country for the next two years.The Bank’s program has two main focus areas:Public sector management and service deliveryEconomic competitivenessThe Bank is also supporting the country to strengthen public resource management, facilitate public service delivery, improve the quality of environmental assets, improve selected infrastructure networks, increase the country’s financial inclusion, reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector, and bolster economic activities in rural areas.Key EngagementOn December 19–21, 2018, more than 150 participants from the Government of Azerbaijan, together with representatives of development partners, civil society, the diplomatic community, and academic and research institutions, came together for the Azerbaijan Human Capital Forum.Recognizing the key role of human capital in growth and development over the long term, the three-day, high-level forum was organized by the WBG in partnership with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population.The goal of the forum was to support the Government in accelerating investments in human capital as a critical step to boosting more inclusive and sustainable growth. The gathering underscored the importance of enhanced investments in human capital in preparing Azerbaijan’s citizens for the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization and technological innovation. With the confluence of rapid technical change and globalization and the need to engage in the global knowledge economy, investments in human capital will be key to Azerbaijan’s ability to collaborate and compete with other nations.Although forum participants expressed appreciation of the tremendous progress Azerbaijan has made on multiple fronts since its independence a generation ago, they also acknowledged that the current level of human capital and its contribution to the national wealth is not commensurate with the country’s income level.Several recommendations emerged on ways to support Azerbaijan to improve its human capital, including the need to increase public spending on health and education, improve the access and quality of early education, narrow the learning gap, increase the access to tertiary education and reform vocational training, reduce out-of-pocket expenditure in health, strengthen the primary health care system, do more to identify vulnerable households, and expand the social safety nets that target poverty.

        Azerbaijan’s economy grew by 2.2 percent in 2019, its best performance since 2014. On the supply side, the hydrocarbon sector stagnated, as surging natural gas output, up by 27.7 percent year on year, was offset by a 3.3 percent decline in oil production.At the same time, non-energy GDP grew at a solid 3.5 percent, with agriculture and services driving the expansion. On the demand side, investment remained anemic while rising real incomes, as a result of higher government spending, supported consumption.Azerbaijan's official national poverty rate is low, standing at 5.1 percent in 2018. Given the recent increase in private consumption, the poverty rate is estimated to have fallen further in 2019.Inflation remained low in 2019 and early 2020, with annual consumer prices edging up to 2.8 percent year on year in February 2020. With inflation within the Central Bank of Azerbaijan's (CBA) target range of 4.2 percent, the CBA continued to lower the policy rate throughout 2019 and early 2020, cutting it to 7.25 percent.The surpluses on Azerbaijan's external accounts narrowed in 2019. Flat exports and an acceleration in imports reduced the goods trade surplus to 12 percent of GDP in 2019 (from 17 percent in 2018). Similarly, the current account surplus eased to 12 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2019.

        Highlighted ProjectHighway 3 Project – Road Maintenance Reforms  The aspiration to become a major regional economic player and international transit hub prompted Azerbaijan in the mid-2000s to invest in the upgrading of its main road network to motorway standards. Although the oil windfall of recent decades and generous financing from international financial institutions have substantially facilitated implementation of this objective, modernizing ineffective road management and maintenance practices inherited from the Soviet era has proved a challenging task. The World Bank supports the Government of Azerbaijan in implementing motorway maintenance reforms through the Third Highway Project.The reforms envisage a transition from the heavily fragmented, territory-based management of the motorways network to corridor-based operation and maintenance. During the first phase of institutional changes, the Bank project helped the client to establish seven new regional entities in charge of motorway maintenance. After the successful implementation of this phase, the project introduced performance-based contractual relations between the Road Agency and motorway maintenance entities. The new motorway maintenance enterprises are responsible for routine, winter, and emergency maintenance works. The new motorway maintenance enterprises are responsible for routine, winter, and emergency maintenance works, and there are plans to open periodic maintenance services to ensure open competition. The motorway enterprises currently perform a standard set of routine road maintenance and operation activities, such as monitoring and patrolling, cleaning, pavement maintenance, drainage, signalization and signage, and so forth.Going forward, they will be fully responsible for meeting the newly established contractual service standards and performance indicators. Although payments to maintenance enterprises will be made regardless of their inputs, they will be held responsible for maintaining measurable service levels and penalized for each case of non-compliance. Proper implementation of the new business model is expected to help maintain the viability and technical soundness of Azerbaijan’s roads and improve traffic safety.

        Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, supported by sustained economic growth. Based on the international poverty line of $1.90 (using 2011 Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate) a day, it reduced poverty from 43.8 percent in 1991 to 14.8 percent by 2016.Life expectancy, literacy rates and per capita food production have increased significantly. Progress has been underpinned by steady growth in GDP. Bangladesh reached the lower middle-income country status in 2015. In 2018, Bangladesh fulfilled all three eligibility criteria for graduation from the UN’s Least Developed Countries (LDC) list for the first time and is on track for graduation in 2024.Sustained economic growth has created an increased demand for energy, transport and urbanization. Insufficient planning and investment have resulted in severe infrastructure bottlenecks, congestion and pollution. To become an upper-middle income economy, continued sound macroeconomic management, financial sector stability, structural reforms, investment in human capital, higher female labor force participation, and global integration will be important. Improving infrastructure as well as the business climate would allow new productive sectors to develop and generate quality employment.ChallengesBangladesh is both an inspiration and a challenge for policymakers and practitioners of development. While the country recorded strong performance in income growth and human development, Bangladesh faces daunting challenges with an increased level of vulnerability with about 39 million people still living below the national poverty line.The COVID-19 pandemic will deepen the challenges including a decline in exports, lower private investment, and job losses. Investment and exports are likely to continue to suffer amid uncertainty about the recovery of global demand. The poor and vulnerable are more impacted with income loss and poverty may rise. The implementation of the government’s COVID-19 response program will remain a paramount priority.Creating more and better jobs for its youth remains a critical priority for Bangladesh to turn around and achieve its development vision. To do so, Bangladesh will need to remove the barriers to higher investment posed by low access to reliable and affordable power, poor transportation infrastructure, limited availability of serviced land, uncertain and complex business regulation, among others. Challenges related to COVID-19, rapid urbanization and climate change need to be addressed through long-term planning.With the right policies and timely action, Bangladesh can accelerate its recovery from the economic downturn and continue to progress towards upper-middle income status.

        The World Bank has been a longstanding partner of Bangladesh since its independence. Since then, the World Bank through its concessional lending arm—the International Development Association (IDA)—has committed more than $30 billion in grants, interest-free and concessional financing credits to Bangladesh. In recent years, Bangladesh has been among one of the largest recipient countries of the IDA fund with the largest ongoing IDA program.The World Bank has also been the largest external funder of Bangladesh providing over a quarter of all foreign aid to the country.The World Bank has been supporting the government efforts in economic development and growth, power, infrastructure, disaster management, climate change, human and social development and poverty reduction.COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORKThe World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2016-2020 supports Bangladesh to achieve its vision of reaching middle-income status by its 50th birthday in 2021. During the period, the World Bank Group’s technical and financial assistance focuses on (i) accelerating growth by helping to remove bottlenecks to growth and shift more financing to increase electricity supply and improve transport connectivity; (ii) foster social inclusion by building on Bangladesh’s impressive gains in human and social development; and (iii) strengthen climate and environmental management with the aim to enhance Bangladesh’s resilience to natural disasters, improving water and natural resource management and modernizing agriculture. The framework is anchored in the government’s seventh Five Year Plan which covers the same period.The World Bank has also consulted with its stakeholders -- government, civil society, and the private sector -- for a mid-term review of the CPF.THE WORLD BANK PROGRAM and Support to Fight COVID-19:The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted economic activity and created an unprecedented challenge globally and in Bangladesh. This is likely to worsen poverty in the short term. The disruption of the supply chains and the depression in the US and the European markets significantly impacted Bangladesh’s exports.Bangladesh government took fast public health measures and announced a package of support programs to help the poor and vulnerable households with cash transfer and food programs, provide stimulus package to firms to sustain employment in key sectors. In addition to extending financial assistance, the government helped reduce regulatory burdens on businesses. As Bangladesh’s long-standing partner, the World Bank stepped up to provide quick support. Within three weeks of detection of the first COVID-19 case in Bangladesh, the World Bank approved $100 million to help Bangladesh prevent, detect and treat COVID-19 and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness. The World Bank will also support Bangladesh government in procurement of vaccines and development of a strategy for vaccination. Further, since the pandemic started, the World Bank approved $1.7 billion to help Bangladesh create jobs and rebound. The World Bank will continue to support to with the aim of “building back better,” including an agenda for reforms and effective investments which will leverage the private sector, help job recovery, boost human capital development and strengthen protections for the vulnerable people.The World Bank support for Bangladesh for FY21–22 is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Approach Paper on “Saving Lives, Scaling-up Impact and Getting Back on Track.”Total IDA commitments as of today stands at $14.02 billion for 53 active projects. Bangladesh is currently the largest IDA borrower globally.

        EducationBangladesh has made remarkable gains in ensuring access to basic and secondary education in the past two decades. In 2018, the country’s net enrollment rate at the primary school level reached above 97 percent, and that at secondary school level, around 62 percent.With nearly 6.4 million girls in secondary schools in 2015, Bangladesh is among the few countries to achieve gender parity in school enrollment and has more girls than boys in secondary schools. Improving the quality of education remains the largest challenge for Bangladesh at all levels. However, around 18 percent of children ages 6-11 remain out of school – either having never enrolled or dropped out before completing grade 5. Socio-economic issues coupled with less women-friendly environment at the post-secondary level also marks slow gains in female labor force participation.Due to high level of early drop outs in Bangladesh in previous years cumulative size of youth who are Not in Education, Earning or Training (NEET) with less than primary education is estimated at around 12 million at this moment, most of whom are women from rural areas. Bangladesh is actively aiming at providing non-formal education and basic skills development to support to this group including basic knowledge on hygiene practices, social coherence, road safety, economic opportunities and so on.The World Bank is playing a role in training Bangladeshi youth for jobs through its skills, higher education and college financing projects. The country is gradually overcoming the issue of equitable access and quality at the post-secondary level with a combination of policy change and participation of the private sector. But more policy initiatives from the government and development partners would be critical for quality education access to all.Government spending on education is 2.4% of the GDP, one of the lowest among countries at similar levels of development. IDA is the largest external funder in the education sector covering the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, as well as technical and vocational education and training, and education for the hard-to-reach children.The World Bank is supporting the Government respond to the COVID-19 impact and build back a better and resilient education system through new and existing operations. These operations support remote learning, safe school reopening, student learning assessment and remedial education, enhancing digital connectivity and capacity building for better prepared school teachers and management at local and central levels.Health, Nutrition and PopulationBangladesh has embraced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 3, encompassing universal health coverage. Progress on maternal and child health and nutrition, as well as fertility, has been better than would be expected given Bangladesh’s low level of public expenditure on health. While there is some evidence that improvements in maternal and infant mortality have slowed recently, reductions in child malnutrition have been faster than elsewhere, although on average one-third of children are stunted. Thus, there is a significant unfinished agenda for improving basic primary health, nutrition and population (HNP) services.While many service utilization indicators, such as immunization coverage, have reached high levels, it is necessary to maintain those gains, achieve still higher coverage, improve quality, and reduce socio-economic and geographic inequalities.At the same time, as it transitions to a middle-income economy, the country needs to address important financing, governance, and system management gaps for effective use of the necessary increased public spending on health. Bangladesh also faces emerging challenges arising from non-communicable diseases, urbanization and climate change as well as adolescent health.The World Bank is supporting Bangladesh in aligning financing and technical support to meet these challenges. The Bank supports the government’s fourth HNP sector program for the period 2017-22, strengthening health system governance and management capacities, and delivery of  essential services, with a focus on the lagging regions of Sylhet and Chittagong Divisions. With financing from IDA, the Global Financing Facility (GFF), Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Health Sector Support Program contributes $700 million to the government’s program. The GFF is fostering collaboration between the HNP and education sectors to improve adolescent health and nutrition.In addition, the World Bank is working with the government of Bangladesh through the Emergency Multi-Sector Rohingya Crisis Response Project and the Additional Financing for Health Sector Support Project to provide essential health services, education, and life skills training, and basic services for the one million displaced Rohingya and the host communities in Cox’s Bazar, one of Bangladesh’s poorest districts.The COVID-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic Preparedness Project is helping selected health facilities and laboratories to detect, manage and treat suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases and support screening in Bangladesh’s designated health facilities and entry points. Rural InfrastructureIDA has been a major partner in the development of Bangladesh’s rural infrastructure, having funded three consecutive rural road improvement projects. By improving the livelihoods of rural women, around 820 km of Upazila and Union roads have been improved along with maintenance of almost 4,500 km rural roads in 26 districts, as well as dredging of 46 km of rural waterways.Additional financing will also promote road safety engineering measures and community road safety campaign in project districts. All these activities have improved safer access to schools and health facilities, reduced transport costs, increased rural non-farm incomes, and generated employment in project areas, for both women and men.Further, IDA support has helped build piped and non-piped water sources that provided safe and arsenic-free water to nearly 1.48 million beneficiaries. Water connections were created for 21,802 households, resulting in an estimated 98,109 people gaining access to safe water through new piped schemes. A total of 20,475 deep tube wells, rain water harvesting structures, pond sand filter and ring wells were constructed. In addition, 10,24,090 people received improved sanitation access from new latrines.The Bangladesh Rural Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Human Capital Development Project will help about 600,000 people avail safe and clean water through large and small piped water schemes in rural areas. It will also provide access to improved sanitation services to over 3.6 million rural people.EnergyBangladesh has made considerable headway in increasing access to electricity and power generation capacity. The access to electricity reached to 97% (grid and off-grid) and the current installed generation capacity has increased to 22,692 MW including captive power and renewables. However, the sector is still facing challenges in ensuring reliable power supply mostly because of distribution breakdowns, inefficiency related to aged system and inadequate transmission and distribution networks. In the last decade, energy demand in Bangladesh has increased on an average of 10 percent per annum.The World Bank has $1.83 billion of ongoing support in the energy sector to enhance capacity, generate clean energy, improve efficiency in generation and transmission & system operation, reduce technical losses, improve transmission and rural distribution network as well as increase access to both grid and renewable electricity. IDA support has so far added 2,652 MW electricity to the national grid, and 181 MW in off-grid areas through installation of solar home systems, solar irrigation pumps, solar mini-grids and installed more than one million improved cookstoves. Another 310 MW capacity will be added to the national grid through ongoing grid-tied solar projects.Bank has also been engaged in promoting power sector policies and institutional capacity building within the Government, power and gas utilities and Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) with the aim to improve the financial health, investment and service quality.In COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for electricity dropped in first few months, and has slowly picking up but remains below the 2019 peak. The projected demand has not been met. The pandemic has caused sales revenue to drop and weak utility finances require government support to meet operational expenditures. The declining levels of employment and household income will erode affordability of the electricity consumers.  AgricultureDespite high population density, decreasing arable land, and frequent natural disasters, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in achieving food security and reducing poverty. While having one of the fastest rates of agriculture productivity growth in the world since 1995 (2.7 percent per year and second only to China), self-sufficiency is continuously threatened by a decrease of arable land by at least one percent per year, an increasing population, and declining output growth with the share of agriculture in total GDP decreasing from 28 percent in 1990 to just 13 percent in 2018. This has contributed to a decline in employment growth and to a slowdown in poverty reduction. The major challenges that contributed to the recent slowdown in agricultural growth include the lack of agricultural diversification, rice-focused agricultural policies, poor logistics and transportation, limited processing and commercialization, weak food safety and quality regulations, recurrent natural disasters and climate change negative effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Bangladesh agriculture negatively but the aftermath could spur policy change and innovation to improve Bangladesh’s resilience and participation in global value chains.The World Bank’s strategic framework in Bangladesh aims to support the GoB in its desired pivoting of the sector towards climate resilient diversification and value addition for greater job creation, entrepreneurship and resilient food systems.The World Bank is helping over 1 million rural households modernize farm practices and use new climate smart technologies and 2 million household farmers, small and medium-scale agro-entrepreneurs to improve livestock and dairy production sustainably, with higher productivity and better market access. Simultaneously, the World Bank has supported 500,000 households to increase grain reserve to meet their post-disaster needs, and is helping the country improve the quality and efficiency of grain storage management.The Modern Food Storage Facilities Project will increase the storage capacity of Bangladesh’s national strategic grain reserves by 535,500 tons for 4.5 million households. The project is helping Bangladesh address food insecurity in challenging times, such as frequent climate-induced disasters or crisis situations like the current COVID-19 pandemic.Climate ChangeBangladesh’s geographical position renders it especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. The 2014 Climate Change Vulnerability Index ranks Bangladesh as the number one economy at risk to climate change. The vicious circle of natural disaster and poverty, whereby each new calamity risks poor becoming poorer and slows development, is a major challenge to poverty reduction efforts in Bangladesh.The World Bank helped Bangladesh address climate change impacts and disaster risk management.  The country has built stronger disaster-coping mechanisms, and these have significantly reduced the impact of recent storms, cyclones, and floods in terms of numbers of deaths and economic losses.IDA has an ongoing portfolio of $1.3 billion supporting Bangladesh to build resilience against natural disasters and climate change impacts. So far, 416 new cyclone shelters have been constructed; 698 km of embankment has been repaired; 37,000 hectares of  block plantations and 3,000 km of strip plantations have been completed in climate vulnerable areas with additional 60,000 hectares of plantations in the pipeline in coastal and hilly areas to increase climate resilience. Around 40,000 people residing in saline, flood and drought prone areas have received adaptive basic needs (house, water, agriculture, health) and livelihood support; about 6,000 poor and forest dependent households in 200 communities have participated in the alternative livelihoods support programs and currently further 180,000 individuals of 600 forest dependent villages are receiving similar support. In addition, 65,000 poor climate vulnerable coastal fisher families in 450 fisher villages are receiving livelihood support, training and credit and 600 shrimp farming clusters will be supported with climate smart technology market linkages. Local GovernanceLocal government institutions in Bangladesh traditionally had a limited role in delivering services to their citizens due to limited responsibilities coupled with lack of adequate resources. Most government services have often been delivered in a top-down manner, with little accountability to local communities.  Over the past decade, the World Bank has been supporting the government’s move towards a stronger and more accountable local governance system.Since 2006, IDA has been supporting a nationwide program that augments the government’s block grants provided to all 4,504 Union Parishads (the lowest tier of elected local government). The block grant enables Union Parishads to decide and spend on local priorities. Since 2006, the discretionary funds that a Union Parishad receives annually has grown by more than ten-fold and has benefitted 130 million people.Hundreds of community schemes generating employment for the poor have been implemented, including construction or rehabilitation of rural roads, culverts, drainage and embankment systems; water and sanitation facilities; and schools and clinics. Thirty percent of the schemes are women-preferred schemes. Under the ongoing third project, IDA is assisting to institutionalize the block grants with the government’s own resources and supporting a pilot for an urban fiscal transfer system in 16 municipalities, to be scaled-up across all Urban Local Bodies through future World Bank operations.

        AT A GLANCEA small, landlocked country nestled deep in the Himalayas between India and China, Bhutan is characterized by steep mountains and deep valleys, which led to scattered population settlement patterns. The country is famous for its unique philosophy – Gross National Happiness (GNH) – which guides its development. Abundant water resources create ideal conditions for hydropower development which has spurred economic growth. Fiscal revenues from hydropower have helped finance large investments in human capital which led to significant improvements in service delivery and educational and health outcomes. Access to electricity is almost universal while access to functional piped water was 95 percent in 2015.Bhutan maintains solid growth and macroeconomic stability. Hydropower construction and supportive fiscal and monetary policy have contributed to solid growth. Single-digit inflation, a stable exchange rate, and accumulating international reserves attest to the stability. Nevertheless, structural challenges remain, including large current account deficits, high public debt, an underdeveloped private sector, and a high youth unemployment rate. A delay in hydropower construction could cloud macroeconomic prospects in the coming years.Bhutan has a stable political and economic environment.  It has made a tremendous progress in reducing extreme poverty and promoting gender equality, while attention is needed to address inequality issues.World Bank Group (WBG) support is guided by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2015-2019 and the 2017 Performance and Learning Review (PLR).  It focuses on improving fiscal and spending efficiency, increasing private-sector growth and competitiveness and supporting green development.  The WBG has also almost completed the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) as a basis for the formulation of its next County Partnership Framework (CPF) in alignment with the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) of the Royal Government of Bhutan. COUNTRY CONTEXTBhutan’s political environment has been stable and economic conditions have improved in recent years. Since Bhutan shifted to a democratic constitutional monarchy in 2008, the country has developed a solid development management system founded on the principle of GNH. The country successfully completed its third parliamentary elections in 2018 and the new government has endorsed the 12th FYP for 2018-2023. Bhutan maintains strong economic and strategic relationships with India, particularly as the major trading partner, as a source of foreign aid and as a financier and buyer of hydropower. Bhutan is vulnerable to natural disasters and climate-related risks.Bhutan has become a lower-middle income country and poverty has been cut by two-thirds in the last decade. Average annual growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been 7.5 percent since the early 1980s, making Bhutan one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, at $3,080 in 2018, is now three times the threshold for lower middle-income countries and only 10 percent below the threshold for upper-middle income countries. Poverty measured using the $3.20 poverty line (in 2011 PPP terms) has declined from 36 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2017. There was good progress in shared prosperity, though the pace of progress slowed down in recent years.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSBhutan’s economy continues to be dominated by hydropower and its economic relationship with India. Growth is estimated to have rebounded to 5 percent in FY2019 after a deceleration to 4.6 percent in FY2018 due to maintenance and on-boarding delays on two major power plants (Tala and Mangdechhu). On the demand side, growth was underpinned by exports and consumption, reflecting the progress in hydropower maintenance and a procyclical public demand response to the associated income inflows. Services remain the main driver of growth on the supply side, where wholesale and retail trade has emerged as the key contributing sub-sector.Approximately 80 percent of Bhutan’s imports are from India, and the Bhutanese Ngultrum is pegged to the Indian Rupee. Thus, inflation between the countries is closely linked. FY2019 began with a slowdown in inflation, hitting a low of just above 2 percent in July 2018 before gradually increasing to 3.1 percent in April 2019 due to food and oil price dynamics. The exchange rate has followed the appreciation of the Indian Rupee in recent months, decreasing from 70.78 BTN per USD to about 69 BTN per USD in August 2019.Developments in the hydropower sector also contributed to a narrowing of the current account deficit to 16.3 percent of GDP in FY2019, as exports from the Tala plant expanded after the conclusion of maintenance work. At the same time, tourist arrivals increased by 8 percent in FY2019, contributing to the growth of service exports. The current account deficit was primarily financed through capital inflows from India. Foreign exchange reserves cover nearly 10.1 months of imports.Bhutan has maintained its course of sustainable public finances, with the fiscal deficit estimated to have reduced to 2.1 percent of GDP in FY2019, from 4.6 percent two years prior. This reflects revenue growth from reforms that increased the corporate income tax base and changed the valuation rules for sales tax on vehicles in FY2018, and a slowdown in the initiation of new capital projects which limited spending growth. Government debt is estimated at 109.3 percent of GDP and is considered sustainable due to a special financing arrangement with India, which covers construction risks of hydropower plants and guarantees a return on surplus power purchases.Little progress was observed in the labor market as labor force participation fell from 65.7 percent in 2017 to 62.6 percent in 2018. Agriculture contributes only 10 percent to GDP but accounts for 54 percent of employment. Working in agriculture is highly correlated with being poor: about 66 percent of poor household heads work in agriculture. Increases in agricultural exports and productivity helped reduce poverty in recent years. Extreme poverty at USD 1.90 per day is almost eliminated, a laudable achievement. The USD 3.20 poverty rate (in 2011 PPP) is estimated to have declined from 12 percent in 2017 to 11.2 percent in 2018. Hydropower is capital intensive and contributes little to job creation. Overall unemployment is low, but high youth unemployment represents Bhutan’s challenge to create more and better jobs.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKGrowth is expected to edge up to 7.4 percent in FY2020 on the back of increased hydropower exports from the newly on-boarded Mangdechhu plant. In the medium term, growth is expected to stabilize between 5 and 6 percent, supported by the initiation of new public investment projects under the 12th Five Year Plan and the construction of the Punatsangchhu I and II hydro plants.Inflation is expected to increase moderately in the near term, following a strong growth outlook in India and firming food and fuel prices. Increased hydropower exports are expected to narrow the current account deficit further, to 10 and 7 percent of GDP in FY2020 and FY2021, respectively.The fiscal outlook for Bhutan foresees a joint expansion of revenue and expenditure that will temporarily widen the fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP by FY2021. Revenue growth is expected due to increased hydro revenue from the Mangdechhu power plant and the introduction of a green tax on fuel and a goods and services tax (GST). Expenditure growth in the short-term is expected to outpace revenue growth due to increased investments in non-hydro projects as part of the 12th Five-Year-Plan and public sector wage increases.Poverty reduction will continue at a modest pace in the near term. The USD 3.20 poverty rate is expected to decline to 9.9 percent in 2019 and 8.7 percent in 2020. Diversification into non-hydropower sectors remains the key challenge to accelerating job creation in non-farm sectors. Maximizing the growth potential of the tourism sector could significantly contribute to jobs and income growth, especially among the rural poor and low-skilled. As poverty is almost exclusively rural, efforts to develop agribusinesses and increase agricultural productivity will need to continue, by investing in the downstream value chain.

Single-digit inflation, a stable exchange rate, and accumulating international reserves attest to the stability. Nevertheless, structural challenges remain, including large current account deficits, high public debt, an underdeveloped private sector, and a high youth unemployment rate. A delay in hydropower construction could cloud macroeconomic prospects in the coming years.Bhutan has a stable political and economic environment.  It has made a tremendous progress in reducing extreme poverty and promoting gender equality, while attention is needed to address inequality issues.World Bank Group (WBG) support is guided by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2015-2019 and the 2017 Performance and Learning Review (PLR).  It focuses on improving fiscal and spending efficiency, increasing private-sector growth and competitiveness and supporting green development.  The WBG has also almost completed the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) as a basis for the formulation of its next County Partnership Framework (CPF) in alignment with the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) of the Royal Government of Bhutan. COUNTRY CONTEXTBhutan’s political environment has been stable and economic conditions have improved in recent years. Since Bhutan shifted to a democratic constitutional monarchy in 2008, the country has developed a solid development management system founded on the principle of GNH. The country successfully completed its third parliamentary elections in 2018 and the new government has endorsed the 12th FYP for 2018-2023. Bhutan maintains strong economic and strategic relationships with India, particularly as the major trading partner, as a source of foreign aid and as a financier and buyer of hydropower. Bhutan is vulnerable to natural disasters and climate-related risks.Bhutan has become a lower-middle income country and poverty has been cut by two-thirds in the last decade. Average annual growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been 7.5 percent since the early 1980s, making Bhutan one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, at $3,080 in 2018, is now three times the threshold for lower middle-income countries and only 10 percent below the threshold for upper-middle income countries. Poverty measured using the $3.20 poverty line (in 2011 PPP terms) has declined from 36 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2017. There was good progress in shared prosperity, though the pace of progress slowed down in recent years.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSBhutan’s economy continues to be dominated by hydropower and its economic relationship with India. Growth is estimated to have rebounded to 5 percent in FY2019 after a deceleration to 4.6 percent in FY2018 due to maintenance and on-boarding delays on two major power plants (Tala and Mangdechhu). On the demand side, growth was underpinned by exports and consumption, reflecting the progress in hydropower maintenance and a procyclical public demand response to the associated income inflows. Services remain the main driver of growth on the supply side, where wholesale and retail trade has emerged as the key contributing sub-sector.Approximately 80 percent of Bhutan’s imports are from India, and the Bhutanese Ngultrum is pegged to the Indian Rupee. Thus, inflation between the countries is closely linked. FY2019 began with a slowdown in inflation, hitting a low of just above 2 percent in July 2018 before gradually increasing to 3.1 percent in April 2019 due to food and oil price dynamics. The exchange rate has followed the appreciation of the Indian Rupee in recent months, decreasing from 70.78 BTN per USD to about 69 BTN per USD in August 2019.Developments in the hydropower sector also contributed to a narrowing of the current account deficit to 16.3 percent of GDP in FY2019, as exports from the Tala plant expanded after the conclusion of maintenance work. At the same time, tourist arrivals increased by 8 percent in FY2019, contributing to the growth of service exports. The current account deficit was primarily financed through capital inflows from India. Foreign exchange reserves cover nearly 10.1 months of imports.Bhutan has maintained its course of sustainable public finances, with the fiscal deficit estimated to have reduced to 2.1 percent of GDP in FY2019, from 4.6 percent two years prior. This reflects revenue growth from reforms that increased the corporate income tax base and changed the valuation rules for sales tax on vehicles in FY2018, and a slowdown in the initiation of new capital projects which limited spending growth. Government debt is estimated at 109.3 percent of GDP and is considered sustainable due to a special financing arrangement with India, which covers construction risks of hydropower plants and guarantees a return on surplus power purchases.Little progress was observed in the labor market as labor force participation fell from 65.7 percent in 2017 to 62.6 percent in 2018. Agriculture contributes only 10 percent to GDP but accounts for 54 percent of employment. Working in agriculture is highly correlated with being poor: about 66 percent of poor household heads work in agriculture. Increases in agricultural exports and productivity helped reduce poverty in recent years. Extreme poverty at USD 1.90 per day is almost eliminated, a laudable achievement. The USD 3.20 poverty rate (in 2011 PPP) is estimated to have declined from 12 percent in 2017 to 11.2 percent in 2018. Hydropower is capital intensive and contributes little to job creation. Overall unemployment is low, but high youth unemployment represents Bhutan’s challenge to create more and better jobs.ECONOMIC OUTLOOKGrowth is expected to edge up to 7.4 percent in FY2020 on the back of increased hydropower exports from the newly on-boarded Mangdechhu plant. In the medium term, growth is expected to stabilize between 5 and 6 percent, supported by the initiation of new public investment projects under the 12th Five Year Plan and the construction of the Punatsangchhu I and II hydro plants.Inflation is expected to increase moderately in the near term, following a strong growth outlook in India and firming food and fuel prices. Increased hydropower exports are expected to narrow the current account deficit further, to 10 and 7 percent of GDP in FY2020 and FY2021, respectively.The fiscal outlook for Bhutan foresees a joint expansion of revenue and expenditure that will temporarily widen the fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP by FY2021. Revenue growth is expected due to increased hydro revenue from the Mangdechhu power plant and the introduction of a green tax on fuel and a goods and services tax (GST). Expenditure growth in the short-term is expected to outpace revenue growth due to increased investments in non-hydro projects as part of the 12th Five-Year-Plan and public sector wage increases.Poverty reduction will continue at a modest pace in the near term. The USD 3.20 poverty rate is expected to decline to 9.9 percent in 2019 and 8.7 percent in 2020. Diversification into non-hydropower sectors remains the key challenge to accelerating job creation in non-farm sectors. Maximizing the growth potential of the tourism sector could significantly contribute to jobs and income growth, especially among the rural poor and low-skilled. As poverty is almost exclusively rural, efforts to develop agribusinesses and increase agricultural productivity will need to continue, by investing in the downstream value chain.

        The World Bank Group and BhutanBhutan became a member of The World Bank in 1981, International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2003, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 2014.  WBG support is guided by the CPS. The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Bhutan’s aspirations to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. The CPS is aligned with the Royal Government’s FYP and WBG activities are organized under three results areas: improving fiscal and spending efficiency; increasing private-sector growth and competitiveness; and supporting green development.The PLR was completed in June 2017. It assesses the first two years of implementation of CPS and updates the focus of WBG’s support program.  The WBG is making progress toward achieving the expected CPS outcomes, although implementation of some investment projects has been delayed, primarily due to insufficient government capacity and problems with procurement. The WBG program is expected to expand and intensify across the three CPS results areas.  Discussions are underway with the government to build a pipeline of activities in conjunction with the preparation of the 12th FYP. Priority areas include economic diversification, job creation, decentralization, urbanization, and education. The WBG has also almost completed the SCD as a basis for the formulation of its next CPF in alignment to the 12th FYP of the Royal Government of Bhutan.Bhutan is eligible for concessional financing support from the International Development Association (IDA). Under IDA17 (FY2015-17), Bhutan had a total allocation of $56 million in IDA financing. Under IDA18 (FY2018-20), Bhutan is eligible to receive approximately $106 million in IDA financing with more favorable terms. To support Bhutan’s development with the increased availability of IDA financing with better terms, the World Bank is already in discussions with the Government to ensure alignment with the government priorities and programs under the 12th FYP. Bhutan is one of about 30 early adopters of the Human Capital Project (HCP), a global effort to accelerate more and better investments in people for greater equity and economic growth and participated in the joint Bhutan Nepal HCP Forum in June 2019.World Bank ProgramAs of October 2019, IDA lending portfolio consists of a Development Policy Credit (DPC, $30 million). To complement the project with IDA credits, the World Bank also provides support through more than 12 grants / trust-funded activities including Bhutan Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) readiness project ($8.6 million); Global Agriculture Food Security Program ($8 million);  Hydromet Services and Disaster Resilience Regional Project ($3.8 million); Youth Employment and Rural Entrepreneurship Project ($1.25 million) and the Preparation of Strategic Program of Climate Resilience ($1.5 million). These activities are underpinned by Advisory Services and Analytics. The World Bank, for example, has conducted Forestry Note, Urban Policy Notes, an In-Depth Labor Study, Managing Environmental and Social Impacts of Hydropower in Bhutan, Investment Climate Assessment, Agribusiness Policy Note, Bhutan Development Update and Practical solutions for addressing labor-related barriers to Bhutan’s private employment growth.World Bank-IFC CollaborationThe IFC has a total committed investment portfolio in Bhutan of about $25 million. The portfolio consists predominantly of IFC’s investments in the financial sector, a hazelnut plantation project and support for the expansion of a local hotel.  The advisory portfolio includes advice in structuring PPPs, improving Bhutan’s investment climate and enhancing access to financial services.IFC continues to explore areas of assistance in financial, tourism, manufacturing and agribusiness, sectors among others. IFC’s advisory support on investment climate reforms, infrastructure development through PPPs and the financial sector is expected to continue.IFC and the World Bank work together to strengthen Bhutan’s financial market and investment climate. The second in a series of development credits includes policy and regulatory actions to promote private sector employment opportunities.  The two institutions also coordinated closely in developing a public-private partnership policy, a tourism policy note and an agribusiness strengthening note for the Government.The World Bank helped Bhutan create a Financial Sector Development Action Plan, centered on enhancing financial inclusion. IFC hosted two major events to promote understanding of the subject among stakeholders. It is advising commercial banks and the central bank on implementing best practices which will further encourage financial inclusion.MIGAOn October 21, 2014, Bhutan became the 181st member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).  MIGA has yet to guarantee a project in the country, but the Agency remains engaged and is ready to support productive projects, across sectors, in Bhutan.

        Under the current CPS, outcomes have been moderately satisfactory and notable advances have been made in the three results areas.Improving fiscal and spending efficiencyThe WBG under this results area made good progress in supporting government reforms to increase revenues, lower deficit and stronger public financial management and procurement systems. The WBG deepened its engagement in this area through a series of DPCs and ASA activities to promote policy measures that enabled government to improve revenue and expenditure performance. The country’s fiscal discipline is expected to be further strengthened through the introduction of GST and the work on fiscal rules as part of the next DPC series.  The 2016 Pubic Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments confirmed that Bhutan has good fiscal discipline through comprehensive coverage of budget execution, good control of expenditure commitments and oversight aggregate fiscal risk and the quality and timeliness of budget reports. The government with the support from the Bank’s technical assistance developed a PFM Reform Strategy and Action Plan and the Multi Donor Fund (PFM-MDF) has been supporting to implement key reform activities. Increasing Private sector growth and competitivenessThe private sector in Bhutan is in its early stages of development. Its potential to engage in sectors that are currently dominated by the state is yet to be realized with an appropriate regulatory and policy environment. The government, with the support of the WBG, has taken important steps in formulating policy reforms to simplify business procedures and spur private investment. The CPS program made progress in improving efficiency of and access to financial services and streamlining institutional process for improved business environment. The programmatic DPC series and ASA supported various reforms and systems enhancement to simplify business procedures. However, these progresses have not yet been fully translated into private sector development.   Supporting Green DevelopmentThe WBG supported to promote improved irrigation and agroeconomic practices and rehabilitation of productive assets for key commodities. Despite implementation challenges the program helped to increase agriculture productivity in key commodity such as paddy. The access to urban infrastructure improved in addition to increased revenue generation for Thimphu municipality. IFC’s first PPP concession for Thimphu City parking facilities is a significant milestone for Bhutan’s further engagement with the private sector. The Bank’s strong partnership through various grant mechanisms enabled government to mainstream biodiversity conservation into national planning which is highly relevant to improving the management of natural capital and resilience to the impacts of climate change. ASAs are underway that are looking into the causes of deforestation and forest degradation, as well as prospects for improved forest management and natural capital accounting.

        The Burundi Country Partnership Framework (CPF), approved by the World Bank Group's Board of Directors in July 2019,  focuses on two priority areas, namely: (i) strengthening human capital; and (ii) strengthening the fundamental foundations for economic and social resilience. Macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, and effective governance guided by citizen engagement are the foundation of these two priority areas.Burundi receives financing from the WBG through the International Development Association (IDA) on a three-year performance-based cycle. While IDA18 funding amounted to $300 million, the country has also benefited from $15 million from the Regional Sub-Window for Refugee and Host Communities. Its implementation rate was 100% at the end of FY2020 with an average disbursement for the entire portfolio of 27%, well above the 20% target for the Africa Region. The new IDA19 allocation is $321 million. It will be complemented by an allocation of $256 million from the Prevention and Resilience (PRA) window of the Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV) Group. Burundi is also eligible for the IDA19 regional fund, the crisis response fund, and the International Finance Corporation-Multilateral Investment Guarantee Association IDA19 private sector fund. The World Bank's current portfolio in Burundi consists of 12 country projects and three regional projects that together are valued at $863.30 million. The breakdown by sector is: Energy 39%Agriculture 16%Health 15%Governance and job creation 9% Social development 7%Social protection 5% Education 5%- The environment 4%In April 2020, an additional $5 million was released to help the country cope with the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, while emergency funding from the Pandemic Emergency Fund of $1.6 million was disbursed to contribute to a tripartite initiative between the Government of Burundi, technical and financial partners, and the private sector. Through this initiative, Savonor, a company that makes “blue soap,\" reduced the price of soap by half, while   a regular handwashing awareness campaign for the most vulnerable populations was developed. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Burundi focuses on capacity building programs for women entrepreneurs. A Systematic Diagnostic of the private sector is planned for 2021, which will provide options for strategic IFC engagement in Burundi.

        Over the past two decades, Cambodia has undergone a significant transition, reaching lower middle-income status in 2015 and aspiring to attain upper middle-income status by 2030. Driven by garment exports and tourism, Cambodia’s economy has sustained an average growth rate of 8% between 1998 and 2018, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. While easing slightly, growth remained strong, estimated to have reached 7.1% in 2019, after the better-than-expected growth rate of 7.5% in 2018.The global shock triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Cambodia’s economy in 2020 at a time when Cambodia also faces the partial suspension of preferential access to the EU market under the “Everything but Arms” initiative. The outbreak caused sharp deceleration in most of Cambodia’s main engines of growth—tourism, manufacturing exports, and construction—which together account for more than 70% of the country’s growth and almost 40% of paid employment. The economy in 2020 is projected to register negative growth of -2%, the sharpest decline in Cambodia’s recent history. The COVID-19 outbreak and slow recovery in global economic activity, alongside prolonged financial market turmoil, poses risks to Cambodia’s growth outlook. According to official estimates, the poverty rate in 2014 was 13.5% compared to 47.8% in 2007. About 90% of the poor live in the countryside. While Cambodia achieved in 2009 the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty, the vast majority of families who escaped poverty did so by a small margin. Around 4.5 million people remain near-poor, vulnerable to falling back into poverty when exposed to economic and other external shocks. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty in 2020 could increase among households involved in key sectors like tourism, construction, trade, manufacturing and the garment industry.  Health and education, especially quality, remain important challenges and development priorities.Cambodia has made considerable strides in improving maternal and child health, early childhood development, and primary education in rural areas.

        The World Bank’s engagement in Cambodia focuses on its mandate to eliminate poverty and boost shared prosperity by investing in human capital, tackling rural poverty, building basic infrastructure, and empowering communities.Cambodia received its first credit from the World Bank in 1993. Following decades of conflict, the World Bank’s priority areas were to support the reconstruction of social and economic institutions and the development of physical infrastructure. In subsequent partnership programs, increasing focus has been placed on governance reforms, macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth, livelihoods support, and improving and expanding health and education services. Across the program, the Bank supports citizens’ engagement, particularly to enhance government transparency and accountability.Following the Cambodia Country Engagement Note, which was discussed  by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in May 2016, the World Bank Group conducted a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) to identify challenges and priority development areas to achieve strong, inclusive and sustainable growth and shared prosperity in Cambodia.Drawing from the analysis and broad consultations with civil society, academia and development partners, the SCD identified three pathways for development:Enhancing export competitiveness and economic diversification to sustain strong growth and create jobsBuilding human assets to facilitate economic mobility and shared prosperityEnsuring a more sustainable growth pattern by investing in natural capital, climate resilience, and sustainable urban developmentThe World Bank Group’s new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Cambodia for FY19 – 23 was discussed by the Board on May 30, 2019. This five-year strategy is closely aligned with the fourth phase of Cambodia’s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency. The three focus areas of the CPF are to:  promote state efficiency and boost private sector development, foster human development, and improve agricultural productivity and the sustainable use of natural resources. The Cambodia CPF three focus areas are underpinned by specific objectives:The first focus area—promoting state efficiency and boosting private sector development—includes three objectives:Enhancing financial sector development and fostering private enterprises;Strengthening public sector accountability and public financial management; andExpanding and improving sustainable infrastructure.The second focus area—fostering human development—includes two objectives:Enhancing quality of education and alignment with labor demands; andExpanding access to quality early childhood services, along with health care and nutrition services.The third focus area—improving agricultural productivity and strengthening the sustainable use of natural resources—includes two objectives:Strengthening management of water and land resources; andImproving agricultural productivity and diversification.The critical cross-cutting theme - strengthening governance, institutions and citizen engagement - underpins the strategy and is embedded in all World Bank Group-financed activities.The World Bank supports these focus areas through investment projects in education, health and nutrition, roads, improved livelihoods, agriculture diversification, water supply and sanitation, landscape and water resource management, disaster risk management, and community-level service delivery.The knowledge agenda is a significant part of the World Bank’s engagement in Cambodia. Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) on Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship, Economic Diversification, Digital Development,  Social Accountability, Public Sector Performance, Urbanization, Equitable Access to Quality Health and Nutrition services, Environmental Sustainability and Resilience, and Jobs continue to strengthen the understanding of development challenges Cambodia faces and foster dialogue on development policy issues with a broad range of stakeholders.The World Bank supports Cambodia to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and to strengthen the country’s economy for recovery and future resilience. To that end, the Bank is supporting a multi-pronged approach to preventing and mitigating the health impacts as well as strengthening the systems for pandemic emergency response.

The Secondary Education Improvement Project (SEIP) aims to improve secondary education quality by strengthening school-based management; upgrading the qualification of lower secondary school teachers, school leaders, and educational staff; and improving school facilities through the construction and rehabilitation of 100 existing schools and construction of 30 new schools and equipping laboratory facilities at 100 targeted schools. Over the past three and a half years, the project has benefitted 25,865 students, teachers, and educational staff at national and sub-national levels. The Higher Education Quality and Capacity Improvement Project, completed in September 2017, provided scholarships to around 1,000 students to pursue their tertiary education locally and 64 public and private university professors/staff to continue their studies overseas. The project also supported 78 overseas and 254 local training programs for more than 10,000 higher education leaders, managers and lecturers to improve the quality and relevance of Cambodia's higher education. In addition, 45 research grants were awarded to researchers to set up and conduct their research activities. The ongoing Higher Education Improvement Project (HEIP) is working to improve the quality of teaching and learning of five public higher education institutions (HEIs) by improving the curriculum, teaching pedagogy, staff qualifications, teaching and learning facilities, and promoting the linkages with industry to ensure consistency with the job market. The project also provides grants to promote the development and implementation of research projects in STEM and agriculture.The Health Equity and Quality Improvement Project (H-EQIP) is working to improve the equity and quality of health care services throughout Cambodia. H-EQIP is the fourth in a series of World Bank-supported health projects that have helped to expand the health facility network, supplied medical and laboratory equipment, supported equity and financial protection for the poor, supported for establishment of non-communicable disease services and institutionalize and strengthening government capacity and ownership, enhancing quality of care, including improving infection prevention and control,  and provided better sanitation and water quality in health facilities.The Health Equity Fund (HEF) system, part of H-EQIP, now co-finances free access to almost 2.9 cases, including 2.58 million outpatient visits, approximately 159,000 hospital admissions, over 76,000 emergency care cases and 37,500 cases of delivery per year for the poorest people in Cambodia, nationwide and across all public health facilities in the country. Payments for these services, as well as performance-based grants granted for improving quality of healthcare service delivery are disbursed electronically and in a timely manner into health facilities’ bank accounts. This has changed the empowerment and accountability paradigm, where additional resource availability has facilitated facility-level decision-making. The HEF system has also ensured vital funding for maintaining equipment and infrastructure and for dealing with unexpected shortages of drugs and consumables. Through the Voice and Action Project, the World Bank and other development partners are supporting NGOs to improve the quality of service delivery by Commune Councils, Health Centers, and primary schools. The Implementation Plan for Social Accountability (ISAF) currently covers 75% of Cambodia’s provinces, 62% of districts and 56% of communes. ISAF covers 572 out of 1,191 health centers across the country and 1,422 out of Cambodia’s 7,000 primary schools. It also hires more than 3,650 Community Accountability Facilitators to help mobilize their communities to learn about public services, provide feedback to service providers, and take action to improve service quality. By the end of 2017, more than 11,280 Joint Accountability Action Plans (JAAPs) were developed by service providers and community members and 64% of JAAPs’ activities have been implemented to improve public service delivery.In the water supply and sanitation sector, the Bank-financed Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project is supporting investment in water supply in lagging areas in five provinces and in improving wastewater collection and management in Siem Reap city.In the water resources management sector, the World Bank-supported Mekong Integrated Water Resource Management Project has supported the government in establishing the key foundation for effective water resources and fishery management. So far, 70 community fisheries have been established, 100 engine boats and related equipment have been distributed to Community Fisheries, and 330 out of 500 poor families have received a small grant to help diversify their sources of livelihoods.  In addition, with approximately 50 river guard offices and more than 60 demarcations constructed, the Communities Fisheries have completed facilities and resources to prevent illegal fishing. The project has also established hydrological and meteorological monitoring stations, developed water resource modeling and river basin profiles, and constructed water resources monitoring facilities. Over the past 20 years, the World Bank has helped modernize the transport sector in Cambodia. Between 1999 and 2014, the World Bank financed three road projects including Road Rehabilitation Project (1999-2006), Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project (2003-2011), and Road Asset Management Project (2008-2014), which helped improve and rehabilitate critical road infrastructure across the country.More recently, the ongoing Road Asset Management Project II (RAMPII) has been supporting MPWT to improve condition, safety, and climate resilience of over 420 kilometers (km) of  the core national road network – including sections of NR3, NR4, and NR7 – and to introduce a road management system for the core national road network. Performance-based contracting for road construction and maintenance is expanding to promote private sector participation in road maintenance and to optimize maintenance service quality.The recently approved Road Connectivity Improvement Project will support MPWT and MRD to improve climate resilient road access to key economic and human development facilities including markets, schools and hospitals and benefit over 2 million people in the project area. The technical assistance grants in the transport sector provide analytical and advisory support to government counterparts on private sector participation in the road sector, climate resilience rural road accessibility, road safety and green mobility solutions.In agriculture and infrastructure support, the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development Project (LASED II) has helped to improve access to agricultural resources, infrastructure and social services for many citizens in rural communities. Through the project, the government has allocated 17,000 hectares of residential and agriculture farm land to 5,091 landless and land-poor families. So far, 3,362 families received land titles. Beneficiaries have received basic shelter materials and other in-kind assistance, such as an initial six-month food aid, to help with settling-in process. The project has completed 93 km of earth roads and 91 km of laterite roads on its target sites. It also built schools and health posts, which are accessible both to project beneficiaries and to the wider community. The project also provides improved agriculture extension services, enabling beneficiaries to make the best use of the land and engage in agriculture activities as well as foster more sustainable community development. Access to land for the poor or landless families has been – and continues to be – an important aspect of poverty reduction in Cambodia’s rural areas.The Bank has been actively engaged in supporting public financial management (PFM) and public sector strengthening in Cambodia since 2006 beginning with two successive projects and various technical assistance programs. Completed in 2017, the Public Financial Management Modernization Project (PFMMP) contributed to building an operational Financial Management Information System and improved domestic revenue mobilization capability. Currently, the Bank continues to provide support for improving PFM and service delivery through a programmatic technical assistance program funded by Multi-Donor Trust Fund with contribution from the European Union and Australia under the Cambodia Strengthening PFM and Public Sector Performance for Improved Service Delivery Programmatic Advisory Services and Analytics Project (P168407) 2019-2022. The technical assistance program aims to ease institutional bottleneck for service delivery by focusing not only PFM but also broader public sector reform programs of the government and covering four thematic areas: strengthening budgeting, planning and expenditure management; performance systems for enhanced service delivery; supporting innovation, monitoring, and coordination; and just-in-time support.

        Since China began to open up and reform its economy in 1978, GDP growth has averaged almost 10 percent a year, and more than 850 million people have been lifted out of poverty.Today, China is an upper-middle-income country and the world’s second largest economy. But its per capita income is still only about a quarter of that of high-income countries, and about 373 million Chinese are living below the upper-middle-income poverty line of US$5.50 a day. China also lags in labor productivity and human capital.  Income inequality has improved over the last decade but remains relatively high.China’s high growth based on resource-intensive manufacturing, exports, and low-paid labor has largely reached its limits and has led to economic, social, and environmental imbalances. Reducing these imbalances requires shifts in the structure of the economy from low-end manufacturing to higher-end manufacturing and services, and from investment to consumption.Over the past few years, growth has moderated in the face of structural constraints, including declining labor force growth, diminishing returns to investment, and slowing productivity. The challenge going forward is to find new drivers of growth while addressing the social and environmental legacies of China’s previous development path.China’s rapid economic growth exceeded the pace of institutional development, and there are important institutional and reform gaps that China needs to address to ensure a high-quality and sustainable growth path. The role of the state needs to evolve and focus on providing stable market expectations and a clear and fair business environment, as well as strengthening the regulatory system and the rule of law to further support the market system.Given its size, China is central to important regional and global development issues. China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and its air and water pollution affects other countries. Global environmental problems cannot be solved without China’s engagement. Moreover, maintaining economic growth at reasonable levels has important spillovers for the growth of the rest of the world economy.Many of the complex development challenges that China faces are relevant to other countries, including transitioning to a new growth model, rapid aging, building a cost-effective health system, and promoting a lower carbon energy path. China is a growing influence on other developing economies through trade, investment, and ideas.China’s most immediate challenge is related to the economic, social and public health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented economic shock in China and the global economy. China’s economy has started to rebound from the COVID-19 induced shock, but the recovery remains uneven. While supply side constraints have largely eased, domestic demand and especially private consumption remain weak, reflecting lingering behavioral impacts of the pandemic, labor dislocation and slower growth in household incomes.The situation calls for a macroeconomic policy mix aimed at rebuilding confidence and augmenting domestic demand in the short term while supporting the medium-term rebalancing to a greener and more inclusive economy. Specifically, policy makers should aim at closing the gaps in China’s social protection coverage  to help protect workers and households from the distress caused by job and income losses and also boost private consumption. Beyond the immediate impacts, the current outbreak has uncovered vulnerabilities. This calls for resolute policy actions that enhance resilience against similar health shocks, including enhanced food safety, health surveillance and response systems.

        China and the World Bank Group have worked together for almost 40 years. The WBG’s new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY2020 to 2025, issued in December 2019, reflects the evolution of the Bank Group’s relationship with China toward a decline in lending and a more selective engagement in line with the capital increase commitments agreed to by its shareholders in 2018.  The CPF aims to help China address some of its remaining development challenges, notably the transition to more environmentally sustainable growth, strengthen key Chinese institutions engaged in economic and social development, and reduce inequality in lagging regions.World Bank (IBRD) lending will decline over the CPF period. As it does so, the Bank stands ready to provide more technical assistance and policy advice, as well as reimbursable advisory services (RAS), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will engage in China’s private sector, especially in investments in global public goods.The CPF focuses on three areas of engagement:Advancing market and fiscal reforms by improving the environment for competition and private sector development; and achieving more efficient and sustainable subnational fiscal management and infrastructure financing.Promoting greener growth by reducing air, soil, water, and marine plastic pollution; strengthening sustainable natural resource management; promoting low-carbon transport and cities; and facilitating the transition to a lower carbon energy path.Sharing the benefits of growth by increasing access to health and social services; and improving the quality of early childhood development.In addition, under the CPF, the World Bank Group will aim to help increase the transparency of China’s lending and investment activities as well as emphasize the importance of promoting high standards of social and environmental risk management for these activities, and share applicable lessons and knowledge from China’s poverty reduction.The CPF is informed by the Bank Group’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) published in early 2018 and other Bank studies including Innovative China: New Drivers of Growth published in 2019. At the CPF midpoint, the Bank Group will assess progress in CPF implementation.

        China began its partnership with the Bank in 1980, just as it embarked on its reforms. Starting as a recipient of support from the International Development Association (IDA), the Bank Group’s fund for the poorest, China graduated from IDA in 1999 and became a donor in 2007. It became the World Bank’s third largest shareholder upon completion of the capital increase approved in 2010, the 30th anniversary of its partnership. The nature of the Bank’s activities in China has evolved over time as China’s needs and level of development have changed. In the early years, the World Bank brought international experience to help design economic reform strategies, improve project management, and address key bottlenecks to growth. More recently, this two-way relationship has evolved —the World Bank offers international expertise to help address China’s key development challenges and pilot reforms through projects and programs; and China’s development experiences enhance the Bank’s global knowledge and capacity to help other developing countries.ResearchJoint flagship studies have been important for deepening the dialogue on policies and Bank programs and provided a model for other middle-income countries. China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative Society, a joint report by the World Bank and the Development Research Center of China’s State Council, lays out six strategic directions for China’s future: completing the transition to a market economy; accelerating the pace of open innovation; going “green” to transform environmental stresses into green growth as a driver for development; expanding opportunities and services such as health, education and access to jobs for all people; modernizing and strengthening its domestic fiscal system; and seeking mutually beneficial relations with the world by connecting China’s structural reforms to the changing international economy.Urban China: Toward Efficient, Inclusive, and Sustainable Urbanization, also a joint report by the World Bank and the Development Research Center of China’s State Council, recommends that China curb rapid urban sprawl by reforming land requisition, give migrants urban residency and equal access to basic public services, and reform local finances by finding stable revenues and by allowing local governments to borrow directly within strict central rules.Healthy China: Deepening Health Reform in China, Building High-Quality and Value-Based Service Delivery, a joint study on reforming China’s health system in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and the World Health Organization, recommends deeper healthcare reforms by creating a new model of people-centered quality integrated health care that strengthens primary care as the core of the health system; continuously improving health care quality; empowering patients with knowledge and understanding of health services; boosting the status of the health workforce, especially primary-care providers; allowing qualified private health providers to deliver cost-effective services; and prioritizing public investments.Innovative China: New Drivers of Growth, a joint report by the Development Research Center of China’s State Council, the Ministry of Finance and the World Bank Group proposes that China addresses its productivity challenges by promoting the “three Ds” – removing distortions in the economy, accelerating diffusion of existing advanced technologies and innovations, and fostering discovery of new technologies, products, and processes so as to expand China’s productivity frontier. The report develops recommendations in seven areas to promote the “three Ds.” These recommendations focus on strengthening competition across product and factor markets and creating a level playing field for all investors, investing in human capital and improving the targeting of support for innovation and entrepreneurship, and adapting the model of economic governance to adjust the balance between the state and the market.ProjectsWorld Bank-financed projects introduced innovations or piloted new approaches and serve as platforms for knowledge exchange.  Many of them also placed a major emphasis on the environment and climate change. Here are some of our recent projects and results in China:The Sichuan Water Supply and Sanitation Public Private Partnership Project, approved in March 2020, is supporting improved water supply and sanitation services for more than 230,000 rural residents in Deyang in China’s Sichuan Province. Jointly prepared with IFC, the project promotes a more transparent service and financing model through a public-private partnership, which is performance-based and focuses on improved service delivery to customers. The project will contribute to domestic and global public goods by protecting the environment through reduced discharge of untreated wastewater into the tributaries of the Yangtze River.The Hubei Smart and Sustainable Agriculture Project, approved in May 2020, will promote environmentally sustainable and climate-smart agriculture and improve agricultural food quality and safety in one of China’s leading agricultural producers. The project is expected to yield significant climate co-benefits and contribute to the achievement of China’s agriculture-related climate change commitments, including under the Paris Agreement.The Jiangxi Eco-industrial Parks Project, approved in June 2020, will strengthen the province’s institutional and regulatory framework for eco-industrial parks, bringing them in line with international standards and helping to reduce the country’s pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project will generate important lessons that could help make a tangible impact on China’s and thus the world’s environmental footprint.The Renewable Energy and Battery Storage Promotion Project, approved in June 2019, aims to increase the integration and utilization of renewable energy by deploying battery storage systems at scale in China. The project will help China accelerate the ongoing clean energy transition and contribute to the country’s emission reduction targets. The project is being implemented by Hua Xia Bank which has committed co-financing of at least $450 million. Parallel technical assistance, financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), will help improve the policy and regulatory framework for green energy technologies, thereby reducing risks and encouraging private investment.The Guizhou Aged Care System Development Program-for-Results (PforR), approved in March 2019 and co-financed by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), is the first World Bank-financed aged care PforR worldwide. The program is helping China address the challenge of population aging by developing a comprehensive policy and institutional framework for elderly care in the southwestern Guizhou Province, one of the poorest provinces in the country.  The support is focused on increasing equitable access to a basic package of care services for the elderly and strengthening the quality of services and the efficiency of the aged care system.The Green Urban Financing and Innovation Project, approved in May 2019 and co-financed by the German Development Bank (KfW), assists China in launching and operating an innovative financial intermediary facility—the Shanghai Green Urban Financing and Services Co., Ltd (FSC)—that focuses on investments by small cities and towns in three key urban environmental sectors: water, wastewater, and solid waste management. The project is bringing innovative solutions to help China meet its environmental investment needs and achieve its climate targets under its National Determined Contribution. For example, the project pools municipal bond issues into a green asset partially backed by the green finance facility, thereby helping smaller municipalities access capital markets for the first time.Two Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Financing operations, approved in FY18, supported Hunan Province and Dadukou District of Chongqing Municipality in China in implementing reforms that have placed their public finances on a sound and sustainable path. This included the development of tools for debt/fiscal sustainability analysis, a new integrated approach to medium-term capital budgeting, enhanced budget transparency, improvements in the provincial-level monitoring and regulation of the financial health of local governments in Hunan, and greater clarity in the division of government budgets and public sector corporate entities in Dadukou. The reforms piloted in Hunan and Dadukou informed the on-going budget reform agenda in China.The Innovative Financing for Air Pollution Control in Jing-Jin-Ji Program (2016-2021), supports the Hua Xia Bank in providing enterprises with financing to reduce air pollutants and carbon emissions by increasing energy efficiency, investing in clean energy, and tightening air pollution control. The project focuses on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region and the surrounding provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Henan. The program is helping to combat climate change by reducing CO2 emissions by 1.54 million tons per year, equivalent to avoiding nearly 10 GW of new coal power plants over lifetime of the investments.The Hebei Air Pollution Prevention and Control Program (2016-2019) has supported the province’s efforts to reduce air pollution by implementing a combination of targeted measures including a continuous emission monitoring system, replacement of heavily polluting diesel buses with electric vehicles, and a switch from coal-fueled cookstoves to clean gas stoves.The Ningxia Desertification Control and Ecological Protection Project (2012-2020) has helped improve the environment and living conditions of local communities while curbing desertification and land degradation and restoring vegetation. The project has also created new jobs and sources of income for local farmers.The Guizhou Rural Development Project (2014-2020) supports rural development and poverty reduction in one of China’s poorest provinces by organizing small-scale farmers into cooperatives and integrating them into agricultural value chains. These co-ops provide jobs and a source of income to rural women, returned migrant workers, and older people.The Poverty Alleviation and Agriculture-based Industry Pilot and Demonstration in Poor Areas Project (2015-2021) has established 400 farmers cooperatives and invested in rural infrastructure and services in Sichuan, Guizhou and Gansu, benefiting 946,000 people – 343,000 registered as poor and 241,000 as ethnic minorities.

        The archipelago of the Comoros is located in the Indian Ocean, north of the Mozambique Channel and northeast of Madagascar. Political Context Absent from the political scene since 2006, Azali Assoumani came back and won the presidential elections in 2016. His government introduced a series of fiscal and structural reforms. The national congress, convened in February 2018 to review 42 years of independence and the Presidential Rotation system among the islands, recommended an overhaul of the system of a rotating presidency. Assoumani’s mandate was renewed in 2019 after the yes vote in the July 2018-referendum on constitutional reform that expands the power of the presidency.  Economic Overview While the spread of the virus in the Comoros seems to be contained so far, economic activity has strongly slowed. Prior to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the Comoros was still recovering from Cyclone Kenneth (April 2019), with gross domestic product (GDP) growth having fallen to 1.9% in 2019 as a result, from 3.6% in 2018. The pandemic will likely offset the positive impacts from reconstruction efforts after the cyclone, with real GDP growth expected to contract sharply to -1.4% in 2020 (compared to a pre-COVID-19 forecast of 4.4%). The COVID-19 health crisis is impacting Comoros’ economy through various channels. The slowdown of economic activity due to social distancing measures and the disruption of trade and tourism caused by the pandemic constitutes a threat for Comoros’ trade and tourism-related sectors. The expected drop of remittances from the diaspora would substantially reduce households’ income, especially the poorer ones. Revenues from trade, which represent the bulk of the government’s domestic resources, will decrease significantly raising the fiscal deficit. The fiscal and external financing gaps that COVID-19 pandemic will create are expected to be covered primarily by donor assistance, given still limited borrowing possibilities, with public debt sustainability remaining at moderate levels despite the shock. However, the Comoros’ recovery is subject to several vulnerabilities. The current fragile situation of the SNPSF, a money transfer service, could take a sudden turn for the worse and seriously jeopardize financial stability. The possible deterioration of the financial health of state-owned enterprises such as  Comoros Telecom could aggravate the fiscal stance. Notwithstanding, the full economic consequences of COVID-19 are still unclear and subject to high uncertainty around the spread of the disease domestically, as well as overseas. Social Context The Comoros is densely populated, with approximately 465 inhabitants per km2, and more than half of the population (53%) is under the age of 20.  High population density places intense pressure on natural resources and the environment. Due to its location and topography Comoros is among the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, and 54.2 percent of the population live in at-risk areas. Nearly one fourth of the population is extremely poor, unable to buy enough food to meet the minimum nutritional requirements of 2,200 kilocalories per person per day. One-fourth of the country’s poor citizens currently live just below the national poverty line, and could move out of poverty if their consumption level increased by around KMF 167 per capita (or $0.37) per day. However, about 10% of the population is at risk of falling below the national poverty line in the event of unexpected economic shocks. While the Comoros compares reasonably well with lower middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the country’s Human Capital Index—at 0.41—lags behind the global average for lower-middle income countries. Children in the Comoros can expect to complete 8.4 years of schooling by age 18. Girls receive significantly less education than boys, and the rate of adolescent pregnancies is two to three-times that of aspirational peer countries. Chronic malnutrition leads to 31 out of 100 children growing up stunted, which aggravates existing inequalities in the country.

Assoumani’s mandate was renewed in 2019 after the yes vote in the July 2018-referendum on constitutional reform that expands the power of the presidency.  Economic Overview While the spread of the virus in the Comoros seems to be contained so far, economic activity has strongly slowed. Prior to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the Comoros was still recovering from Cyclone Kenneth (April 2019), with gross domestic product (GDP) growth having fallen to 1.9% in 2019 as a result, from 3.6% in 2018. The pandemic will likely offset the positive impacts from reconstruction efforts after the cyclone, with real GDP growth expected to contract sharply to -1.4% in 2020 (compared to a pre-COVID-19 forecast of 4.4%). The COVID-19 health crisis is impacting Comoros’ economy through various channels. The slowdown of economic activity due to social distancing measures and the disruption of trade and tourism caused by the pandemic constitutes a threat for Comoros’ trade and tourism-related sectors. The expected drop of remittances from the diaspora would substantially reduce households’ income, especially the poorer ones. Revenues from trade, which represent the bulk of the government’s domestic resources, will decrease significantly raising the fiscal deficit. The fiscal and external financing gaps that COVID-19 pandemic will create are expected to be covered primarily by donor assistance, given still limited borrowing possibilities, with public debt sustainability remaining at moderate levels despite the shock. However, the Comoros’ recovery is subject to several vulnerabilities. The current fragile situation of the SNPSF, a money transfer service, could take a sudden turn for the worse and seriously jeopardize financial stability. The possible deterioration of the financial health of state-owned enterprises such as  Comoros Telecom could aggravate the fiscal stance. Notwithstanding, the full economic consequences of COVID-19 are still unclear and subject to high uncertainty around the spread of the disease domestically, as well as overseas. Social Context The Comoros is densely populated, with approximately 465 inhabitants per km2, and more than half of the population (53%) is under the age of 20.  High population density places intense pressure on natural resources and the environment. Due to its location and topography Comoros is among the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, and 54.2 percent of the population live in at-risk areas. Nearly one fourth of the population is extremely poor, unable to buy enough food to meet the minimum nutritional requirements of 2,200 kilocalories per person per day. One-fourth of the country’s poor citizens currently live just below the national poverty line, and could move out of poverty if their consumption level increased by around KMF 167 per capita (or $0.37) per day. However, about 10% of the population is at risk of falling below the national poverty line in the event of unexpected economic shocks. While the Comoros compares reasonably well with lower middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the country’s Human Capital Index—at 0.41—lags behind the global average for lower-middle income countries. Children in the Comoros can expect to complete 8.4 years of schooling by age 18. Girls receive significantly less education than boys, and the rate of adolescent pregnancies is two to three-times that of aspirational peer countries. Chronic malnutrition leads to 31 out of 100 children growing up stunted, which aggravates existing inequalities in the country.

        As of July 1, 2020, the World Bank is financing 10 projects in Comoros to the tune of $233 million in the areas of health, social protection, telecommunications, disaster recovery, fisheries, energy, financial inclusion and statistical capacity building.  The World Bank has contributed to the response plans to recent crises in the Comoros. First, the Bank supports the plan to help and fast track the country’s recovery from the cyclone Kenneth (April 2019) as well as the effort to strengthen the country climate resilience.  Through the Comoros Post-Kenneth Recovery and Resilience Project, the Bank supports the development and implementation of a national housing reconstruction program for the most vulnerable cyclone-affected households, and the reconstruction of 1,000 houses across the three islands. Additional financing to the Comoros Social Safety Net Project is targeting 243,300 beneficiaries who will directly benefit from program aimed at increasing the resilience of communities against cyclones and natural disasters.  Second, the Bank, supports the Comoros national health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consists of procuring specific COVID-19 equipment. In addition, more than 21,000 poor and vulnerable households will receive unconditional cash transfer for a period of three months from the Safety Net Project. An Emergency DPO for FY21 will support the government’s relief response and building resilience post-COVID-19. Significant progress was made in the telecommunications sector through the RCIP-4 Project, which is financing the FLY-LION3 submarine cable. Since the launch of the project, the number of mobile telephone users has more than doubled (in relation to the numbers on record at the start of the project), the telecommunications sector has, for the first time, seen rapid private sector-led growth, and the outlook for foreign direct investment (FDI) has improved. The RCIP4 Project received additional financing of $10 million in October 2018 for the development of on-line government services (e-Government). The project helped support the issuance of a second license, facilitating the market entry of Telma in 2016, which introduced competition, and has helped dramatically drive down prices for ICT services and facilitated the introduction of new services such as mobile money.  The entry of Telma has helped increase investment in national infrastructure, expanding network coverage nationally. Full interconnection has been effective since February 2020 between telecom operators. The project has now largely exhausted the intervention options available to support further reform of under-performing state-owned enterprises in the telecoms sector that continues to hamper sector development. Comores Cable (the wholesale operator / SPV) has now operationalized its new business plan, supported by technical assistance provided. The new FLY-Lion 3 cable has now been commercialized, with funding from the project and from other commercial operations in the region. The new landing station is completed. Work focused on supporting an enabling strategic, institutional, and legal environment for e-government is now largely complete.  Through the regional the SWIOFish1Project, the new fishery law was adopted. Notable results toward the completion process of the construction of fishery infrastructure at community levels are observed. The massive motorized boat registration phase began in July 2019 with more than 1,226 motorized boats registered now.  In 2018, the Comoros Statistics Project culminated with the success of the fourth General Census on Population and Housing (RGPH). Under a technical support from the World Bank, the National institute of Economic and Demographic Studies (INSEED) has produced and disseminated a statistical yearbook that presents the detailed census results. The census which is the main activity is quite completed. Progress is also noted on the prices and data. INSEED produces and disseminates timely the monthly prices data. The price data are collected regularly and INSEED produces and disseminates monthly reports and thematical reports. Concerning the national accounts, the action plan agreed with AFRITAC/IMF is being implemented with no big difficulties. The household survey has covered so far 38% of the overall sample corresponding to a delay of 23%.

        The archipelago of the Comoros is located in the Indian Ocean, north of the Mozambique Channel and northeast of Madagascar. Political Context Absent from the political scene since 2006, Azali Assoumani came back and won the presidential elections in 2016.

        Good coordination among donors is essential to maximize development outcomes in a country with very limited capacity. The World Bank is working in close cooperation with France, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the various UN agencies, and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to harmonize donor efforts.

        With a population of 5.2 million (2018) over a surface area of 342,000 km2, the Republic of Congo is sparsely populated, with more than half of the population concentrated in its two largest cities, Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. The rest of the country is one of the least densely populated areas in Africa, with just 12.8 persons per square kilometer.Largely covered by tropical forests, the Republic of Congo also possesses vast expanses of unused arable land that represent approximately one third of its total area. Moreover, the country ranks among the top 10 of Africa’s oil producers and has substantial mineral resources, the majority of which are yet untapped. Political ContextPresident Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who led the People's Republic of the Congo from 1979 to 1992, returned to power in 1997. He won the presidential elections in 2002, 2009, and 2016.In November 2017, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Congolese Government and representatives of the former rebel leader, Frédéric Bintsamou (known as Pastor Ntoumi), who had reignited a rebellion in the department of Pool following the 2016 presidential elections.Peace and security have since gradually returned, while the government and the international community strive to consolidate the still-fragile peace in this southern department of the country. A disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) program established under the control of the United Nations is expected to be launched soon.Economic OverviewAfter the profound economic crisis that plagued the country from mid-2014 following the decline in oil prices, the Congolese economy resumed an upward trajectory in 2018 with real GDP growth projected to reach 1.6% after two years of negative growth.Growth was driven by the increase in oil production and by favorable market conditions, with oil prices holding steady in late 2018 and the resumption of demand from partner emerging countries.Nevertheless, the non-oil sector continues to decline, contracting by 5.5% as a result of the weakening of activity in construction and public works, transport, and telecommunications.Inflation remained contained at 1.2% in 2018 owing to weak domestic demand and a tightening monetary policy. The country's debt burden has decreased, but remains unsustainable despite the signature of a debt restructuring agreement with China in April 2019. The country will also have to restructure its domestic debt and other commercial debt with oil traders.Economic growth is projected to reach 5.4% in 2019, then continue its trajectory, gaining an average of 1.8% per year for the period 2020-21. This outlook is based on a strong hydrocarbon sector and the upturn in investments from 17.1% of GDP in 2018 to 22.7% of GDP in 2019-21, assuming favorable oil prices and budget surpluses.During the same period, non-oil growth, driven primarily by industry, construction, and agriculture, is expected to average 3%, hinging on restoring the confidence of the private sector and implementing structural reforms aligned with the economic and financial program of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC).Development ChallengesAlthough the proportion of the population living below the poverty line fell from 51% in 2005 to 41% in 2011, the extreme poverty rate appears to have increased from 2016, especially in rural areas, as a result of the decline in oil prices.The poorest 65% of Congolese citizens live in the six regions in the south of the country. Less than 4.9% of them are covered by the social protection programs.Congo’s human capital index stands at 0.42, which is below the average for middle-income countries. Despite a slight uptick in per capita income, the country has seen little progress in the areas of health and education. Maternal and infant mortality rates remain high, with 5% of children not making it to their fifth birthday. Chronic malnutrition affects 21% of children, and only 30% of primary students have achieved the required proficiency level in mathematics, 40% in French.Moreover, ranked 180 of 190 countries in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2019 report, which measures business regulation, the Republic of Congo would benefit from improving its governance to attract more private investors.Last Updated: Oct 21, 2019","
        
        The National Development Plan for the period 2018-2022 aims to improve governance, strengthen human capital, and diversify the economy.The World Bank Group is in the process of developing its new Country Partnership Framework with Congo for the 2020-24 period. Aligned with the government’s objectives, this strategy aims to help Congo improve economic management, create an enabling environment for economic diversification, and strengthen its human capital and basic service provision, particularly in the areas of health, education, and social protection.The World Bank is currently financing 10 national projects to the tune of $451 million.The World Bank Group is exploring alternative funding mechanisms for large infrastructure projects, such as collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and through the use of public-private partnerships.

        Gabon, a central African country, is rich in natural resources. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, it borders Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo. It is sparsely populated, with a population of 2 million (2017) and forests covering 85% of its territory.Gabon nonetheless has one of the highest urbanization rates in Africa; more than four in five Gabonese citizens live in cities. The capital, Libreville, and Port Gentil—the economic capital of the country—are home to 59% of the population. One in two Gabonese citizens is under the age of 20, with the fertility rate in urban areas at four children per woman against six in rural areas, according to the 2012 Second Demographic and Health Survey.Political ContextThe Gabonese Democratic Party (Parti démocratique gabonais PDG) dominates the political landscape: Omar Bongo held the presidency for 41 years (1968–2009), and his son, Ali Bongo Ondimba, won the presidential elections in August 2009, against the backdrop of social crisis.The opposition boycotted legislative elections in 2011, but later competed in municipal and departmental elections in December 2013 and in the Senate election in December 2014. Still, all these elections were won by the party in power. On August 31, 2016, the incumbent president, Ali Bongo, was re-elected in controversial elections marked by a fairly low voter turnout of 59%.Legislative and municipal elections were held in October 2018. The ruling party—despite losing 15 seats—maintained its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, winning 98 of 143 seats.  The elections followed an April 2018 constitutional court ruling that dissolved parliament (because elections had been postponed for too long) and forced the government’s resignation in May. A caretaker government has taken measures (contained in the new 2018 Budget Law) to address slippage in Gabon’s macroeconomic performance and contain its bloated wage bill.On January 7, 2019, taking advantage of a prolonged absence by the President of the Republic, who was convalescing in Morocco, several soldiers attempted to seize power. This attempted coup culminated in the arrest of its ringleaders.A new government was sworn in on January 12, 2019, then reorganized by presidential decree on January 30 and June 10, 2019.Economic OverviewGabon is an upper-middle-income country. The fifth largest oil producer in Africa, it has had strong economic growth over the past decade, driven by its production of oil and manganese. The oil sector has accounted for 80% of exports, 45% of GDP, and 60% of fiscal revenue on average over the past five years. However, as the country is facing a decline in its oil reserves, the Gabonese government has decided to diversify its economy.Gabon’s fiscal position worsened in 2015, with the country recording a fiscal deficit for the first time since 1998. Despite the government’s attempts to rein in expenditure and offset the decline in oil revenue, Gabon’s economy stalled in 2017 and was projected to grow by 0.8% in 2018 compared to 0.5% in 2017.This trend is attributable to limited expansion of the secondary and tertiary sectors, impacted by the decline in public expenditure. However, higher prices for crude oil, manganese, and rubber—exported by the country—contributed to growth in the primary sector. Growth could rebound to 2.9% in 2019, driven by non-extractive sectors like agribusiness and upgraded transport and communication networks.The government has launched an audit of the public service payroll: its initial steps included the decision to pay civil servants with vouchers and to carry out physical-presence checks to identify ghost workers. The cabinets of the President and the Prime Minister have reduced their staff by 40%.

Gabon ranked 169 out of 190 countries in the 2018 Doing Business report. The government’s strategy for the promotion of non-oil sectors has so far been based on the granting of specific incentives to foreign investors. A recent World Bank policy note highlighted the importance of improving human capital, building a fair and transparent business environment, and improving the quality and cost of core infrastructure—three critical building blocks for economic and export diversification. Recent measures to improve the business climate include a one-stop shop for investors; a public-private partnership (PPP) framework; a domestic arbitration court; and codes for hydrocarbons and mining.Gabon must also boost its social expenditure. A 2013 McKinsey report suggests that roughly 30% of the population faces vulnerability, surviving on monthly incomes below the guaranteed minimum wage of CFAF 80,000 (approximately $150). The study also notes that the social situation has deteriorated in terms of access to basic social services (health care, drinking water, and electricity) in 60% of the regions.Following this report, Gabon decided to improve its social policy by focusing on three pillars:Establishing integrated social programs for the most vulnerable (the elderly, orphans, the disabled;Creating income-generating activities for the poorest population groups; andReducing inequalities in access to basic public services. Although the net primary enrollment rate is one of the highest in Africa (96.4%), the completion rate in the Gabonese education system is low (37.2%).The weakness of the national statistical system is another challenge Gabon needs to address, as reliable data on poverty and income distribution are not available; the most recent date back to 2010.

The government’s strategy for the promotion of non-oil sectors has so far been based on the granting of specific incentives to foreign investors. A recent World Bank policy note highlighted the importance of improving human capital, building a fair and transparent business environment, and improving the quality and cost of core infrastructure—three critical building blocks for economic and export diversification. Recent measures to improve the business climate include a one-stop shop for investors; a public-private partnership (PPP) framework; a domestic arbitration court; and codes for hydrocarbons and mining.Gabon must also boost its social expenditure. A 2013 McKinsey report suggests that roughly 30% of the population faces vulnerability, surviving on monthly incomes below the guaranteed minimum wage of CFAF 80,000 (approximately $150). The study also notes that the social situation has deteriorated in terms of access to basic social services (health care, drinking water, and electricity) in 60% of the regions.Following this report, Gabon decided to improve its social policy by focusing on three pillars:Establishing integrated social programs for the most vulnerable (the elderly, orphans, the disabled;Creating income-generating activities for the poorest population groups; andReducing inequalities in access to basic public services. Although the net primary enrollment rate is one of the highest in Africa (96.4%), the completion rate in the Gabonese education system is low (37.2%).The weakness of the national statistical system is another challenge Gabon needs to address, as reliable data on poverty and income distribution are not available; the most recent date back to 2010. The consumer price index is still based on household consumption from a 2003 survey.

        World Bank Group Engagement in GabonGabon is an IBRD country. A New Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is in its initial stages of preparation and revolves around two key areas: promoting diversified growth and competitiveness, and increasing the efficiency of social programs and strengthening social protection.The World Bank is currently preparing a diagnostic of the economic and social situation in Gabon so as to determine its next Country Partnership Framework. To this end, it has organized broad consultations with all stakeholders, including civil society and private sector representatives.The World Bank is financing eight projects in Gabon, representing a net commitment of $626.70 million (2019):The Regional Central Africa Fiber Optic Backbone ProjectThe Infrastructure and Local Development Project IIThe E-Gabon ProjectThe Gabon Statistical Development ProjectThe Access to Basic Services in Rural Areas and Capacity Building ProjectThe Skills Development and Employability ProjectThe Sustainable Management of Critical Wetlands Ecosystems ProjectThe Wildlife and Human-Elephant Conflicts Management in the South of Gabon Project .The World Bank regularly reviews progress made and lessons learned in order to assess project implementation and propose adjustments. This review aims to readjust the strategy in accordance with changes in the country context, draw lessons from programs that have been implemented, and reaffirm the World Bank’s stated priority goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

        Gabon, a central African country, is rich in natural resources. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, it borders Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo. It is sparsely populated, with a population of 2 million (2017) and forests covering 85% of its territory.Gabon nonetheless has one of the highest urbanization rates in Africa; more than four in five Gabonese citizens live in cities. The capital, Libreville, and Port Gentil—the economic capital of the country—are home to 59% of the population. One in two Gabonese citizens is under the age of 20, with the fertility rate in urban areas at four children per woman against six in rural areas, according to the 2012 Second Demographic and Health Survey.Political ContextThe Gabonese Democratic Party (Parti démocratique gabonais PDG) dominates the political landscape: Omar Bongo held the presidency for 41 years (1968–2009), and his son, Ali Bongo Ondimba, won the presidential elections in August 2009, against the backdrop of social crisis.The opposition boycotted legislative elections in 2011, but later competed in municipal and departmental elections in December 2013 and in the Senate election in December 2014. Still, all these elections were won by the party in power. On August 31, 2016, the incumbent president, Ali Bongo, was re-elected in controversial elections marked by a fairly low voter turnout of 59%.Legislative and municipal elections were held in October 2018. The ruling party—despite losing 15 seats—maintained its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, winning 98 of 143 seats.  The elections followed an April 2018 constitutional court ruling that dissolved parliament (because elections had been postponed for too long) and forced the government’s resignation in May. A caretaker government has taken measures (contained in the new 2018 Budget Law) to address slippage in Gabon’s macroeconomic performance and contain its bloated wage bill.On January 7, 2019, taking advantage of a prolonged absence by the President of the Republic, who was convalescing in Morocco, several soldiers attempted to seize power. This attempted coup culminated in the arrest of its ringleaders.A new government was sworn in on January 12, 2019, then reorganized by presidential decree on January 30 and June 10, 2019.Economic OverviewGabon is an upper-middle-income country. The fifth largest oil producer in Africa, it has had strong economic growth over the past decade, driven by its production of oil and manganese. The oil sector has accounted for 80% of exports, 45% of GDP, and 60% of fiscal revenue on average over the past five years. However, as the country is facing a decline in its oil reserves, the Gabonese government has decided to diversify its economy.Gabon’s fiscal position worsened in 2015, with the country recording a fiscal deficit for the first time since 1998. Despite the government’s attempts to rein in expenditure and offset the decline in oil revenue, Gabon’s economy stalled in 2017 and was projected to grow by 0.8% in 2018 compared to 0.5% in 2017.This trend is attributable to limited expansion of the secondary and tertiary sectors, impacted by the decline in public expenditure. However, higher prices for crude oil, manganese, and rubber—exported by the country—contributed to growth in the primary sector. Growth could rebound to 2.9% in 2019, driven by non-extractive sectors like agribusiness and upgraded transport and communication networks.The government has launched an audit of the public service payroll: its initial steps included the decision to pay civil servants with vouchers and to carry out physical-presence checks to identify ghost workers. The cabinets of the President and the Prime Minister have reduced their staff by 40%. The government also extended the hiring freeze for another three years—except for social sectors.Development ChallengesThe poor quality of Gabon’s business climate is a major barrier to the diversification of its economy.

        The World Bank Group contributes to Gabon’s development in the following sectors:Improve local infrastructureThe local infrastructure project is a $100 million-funded project that seeks primarily to increase access to basic urban services for people living in poor neighborhoods. The project will enhance the management capabilities of municipalities and develop local private SMEs.Support sustainable management of critical wetlands ecosystemsAn $8.47 million grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) aims to increase the protection of biodiversity in selected forested wetlands on the Ramsar List, through knowledge creation and the development of conservation measures for sustainable wetlands management.Modernize Information and Communications Technology (ICT)The $58 million Central Africa fiber optic Backbone Project became effective on March 6, 2013. It supports the expansion of Gabon’s broadband network, helps reduce the cost of communications throughout Central Africa, and facilitates access to ICT. And the $56 million E-Gabon Project aims to accelerate the development of Gabon’s digital innovation ecosystem, and delivery and management of public health services.

        The Gambia is a small, fragile country in West Africa. Stretching 450 km along the Gambia River, the country  (all 10,689 square kilometers of it) is surrounded by Senegal, except for a 60-km Atlantic Ocean front. The country has a population of 2.1 million. With 176 people per square kilometer, it is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Most of the population (57%) is concentrated around urban and peri-urban centers. Political Context The December 2016 presidential election resulted in a political transition after the incumbent, President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh who had led the country for 22 years, was defeated by Adama Barrow, the presidential candidate of a political coalition. Parliamentary elections in April 2017 led to an absolute majority for the United Democratic Party (UDP) with 31 seats in the 58-seat National Assembly. The former ruling Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) party was reduced to five seats. Local elections in May 2018 resulted in 62 of 120 seats going to the UDP and 18 to the APRC. In December 2019, President Adama Barrow formed a new political party, the National People’s Party, which would allow him to seek a second term in the 2021 elections. A new draft Constitution, which introduces a two-term limit for the presidency, was delivered in November 2019 and is pending approval by the National Assembly and endorsement by the Gambian people through a referendum.  Economic Overview Following strong performance under the 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program , with a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, and debt relief from key plurilateral and bilateral creditors, The Gambia has been able to exit from debt distress. This has paved the way for an Enhanced Credit Facility approved by the IMF Board on March 23, 2020. The fiscal deficit has been reduced from 6.2% of GDP in 2018 to 2.6% of GDP in 2019, supported by increased tax revenues and strong donor inflows. Growth has remained robust at around 6% despite the fiscal adjustment and external shocks, including in the tourism sector. International reserves have been brought closer to prudential levels, interest rates have eased, and inflation has remained stable. The global COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have severe socioeconomic consequences. GDP growth is projected to decline to between 2.5 and -2.4% in 2020. Heavily dependent on tourism, The Gambia is mainly impacted by a reduction in tourists, particularly from key markets in Europe, but also from trade disruption and lower commodity prices. Limited fiscal, monetary, and financial buffers and high risk of debt distress limit room to maneuver. Health sector capacity is weak and social safety nets do not exist.  The government has taken some steps to protect lives and livelihoods during the relief period with support from development partners. The World Bank is providing support through its $10 million COVID-19 Emergency Response Project, and the IMF through its US$21.2 million Rapid Credit Facility. Moreover, the IMF has approved the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust debt relief ($2.9 million). The European Union has disbursed a $9.7 million budget support grant, while the World Bank Social Safety Net Project has been front loaded with an additional $6 million.  The Gambia also seeks debt service deferral under the G20 initiative that could provide between $2.19 million from the creditors already endorsing the initiative to close to $6.68 million if the plurilateral and private creditors endorse the initiative.

        The Gambia is a small, fragile country in West Africa. Stretching 450 km along the Gambia River, the country  (all 10,689 square kilometers of it) is surrounded by Senegal, except for a 60-km Atlantic Ocean front. The country has a population of 2.1 million. With 176 people per square kilometer, it is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Most of the population (57%) is concentrated around urban and peri-urban centers. Political Context The December 2016 presidential election resulted in a political transition after the incumbent, President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh who had led the country for 22 years, was defeated by Adama Barrow, the presidential candidate of a political coalition. Parliamentary elections in April 2017 led to an absolute majority for the United Democratic Party (UDP) with 31 seats in the 58-seat National Assembly. The former ruling Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) party was reduced to five seats. Local elections in May 2018 resulted in 62 of 120 seats going to the UDP and 18 to the APRC. In December 2019, President Adama Barrow formed a new political party, the National People’s Party, which would allow him to seek a second term in the 2021 elections. A new draft Constitution, which introduces a two-term limit for the presidency, was delivered in November 2019 and is pending approval by the National Assembly and endorsement by the Gambian people through a referendum.  Economic Overview Following strong performance under the 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program , with a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, and debt relief from key plurilateral and bilateral creditors, The Gambia has been able to exit from debt distress. This has paved the way for an Enhanced Credit Facility approved by the IMF Board on March 23, 2020. The fiscal deficit has been reduced from 6.2% of GDP in 2018 to 2.6% of GDP in 2019, supported by increased tax revenues and strong donor inflows. Growth has remained robust at around 6% despite the fiscal adjustment and external shocks, including in the tourism sector. International reserves have been brought closer to prudential levels, interest rates have eased, and inflation has remained stable. The global COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have severe socioeconomic consequences. GDP growth is projected to decline to between 2.5 and -2.4% in 2020. Heavily dependent on tourism, The Gambia is mainly impacted by a reduction in tourists, particularly from key markets in Europe, but also from trade disruption and lower commodity prices. Limited fiscal, monetary, and financial buffers and high risk of debt distress limit room to maneuver. Health sector capacity is weak and social safety nets do not exist.  The government has taken some steps to protect lives and livelihoods during the relief period with support from development partners. The World Bank is providing support through its $10 million COVID-19 Emergency Response Project, and the IMF through its US$21.2 million Rapid Credit Facility.

        The World Bank Group continues to contribute to The Gambia’s development performance in several sectors, including the following:Energy Investments under both national and regional energy projects have contributed to increased generation capacity in the Greater Banjul Area, from 25 megawatts (MW) in October 2017 to 80 MW in November 2019, and steady increase in electricity sales at an average rate of 8–10% from 2012 to 2020. The power sector was able to shift from an acute crisis in 2017 to a provider of reliable electricity as system-wide blackouts dropped from 15 to 20 per day to two to three per day. Improved operational performance of NAWEC, the national water and electricity company, led to a reduction in transmission and distribution losses from 28% in 2015 to 19% in 2019. Public Finance, Governance and State-Owned EnterprisesThe Integrated Financial Management Information System project supports improvements in public resource management. The central government budget for fiscal year 2020 was prepared using a Comprehensive Budget Module System introduced through the project. The operation also helps advance reforms for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with  technical assistance in drafting the SOE Bill and performing a special audit of major SOEs. The project has helped pave the way for the design of an action plan to improve SOEs’ performance and governance and reduce fiscal risk. Health and NutritionThe Maternal and Child Nutrition and Health Results Project has contributed to better use of health services and quality of care thanks to results-based financing activities. As of September 30, 2019, more than 115,800 childbirth deliveries were attended by skilled health personnel. In addition, over 59,800 pregnant women received their first antenatal care in the first trimester, 25 times more women than at the beginning of the intervention.

        The World Bank Group’s engagement in Madagascar is guided by the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2017-2021. Developed in consultation with the government, civil society, private sector, and others, the CPF aims to strengthen resilience and reduce the country's fragility while promoting inclusive economic growth. Recommendations drawn from the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), published in 2015, served as a basis for formulating the CPF’s eight objectives:Strengthen cognitive and physical development of childrenStrengthen resilience and improvement of the livelihoods of vulnerable householdsEnhanced and effective decentralizationStrengthen the transparency and accountability of public institutionsBoost the State’s capacity to finance social expenditure and priority infrastructure developmentImprove business environment and access to financeStrengthen local productivityImprove access to energy and transportThis engagement will support the Malagasy Government’s efforts to achieve a number of flagship outcomes: Reduce stunting in children under five years of age by 1 percentage point per annum in regions where chronic malnutrition rates are highestIncrease the number of children completing the primary school cycle by 25%Increase the rate of access to electricity to 20%To achieve these outcomes, at the Conference of Donors in late 2016, the World Bank Group pledged to invest $1.3 billion in Madagascar over a three-year period, including $1 billion from the International Development Association (IDA) and $300 million in financing for the private sector from the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

        As of July 1, 2020, the World Bank is financing 17 projects in Madagascar to the tune of $1.4 billion in the areas of education, nutrition, early childhood development, social protection, resilient agriculture, energy, transport, and support for private sector development.Development policy operations in FY19-20, totaling $200 million, support critical reforms to strengthen the quality and transparency of fiscal decision-making, improve the governance of the electricity sector,  and improve human capital. A $50 million Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option operation also provides Madagascar with rapid access to financing in the event of a natural catastrophe while supporting key reforms that strengthen the country’s system for disaster risk management. At the end of August 2020, a $75 million COVID-19 Response Development Policy Financing was approved to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis (coronavirus) and lay the foundations for a sustainable recovery.The International Development Association (IDA) also provides analytics and advisory services to provide support for evidence-based decision-making and stronger implementation on a wide range of development issues. The World Bank-financed projects have led to the following noteworthy outcomes:Strengthening of human capital266 classrooms have been built through the Madagascar Emergency Support to Education for All Project (PAUET);More than 98,000 children aged six to 10 years can go to school as a result of monthly cash transfers granted to their parents;More than 800,000 vulnerable people  in southern Madagascar are beneficiaries of the FIAVOTA Program, which provides cash transfers combined with health and nutrition interventions, to stabilize the incomes of households hit by drought, building their resilience and improving their well-being. Fifteen months of project implementation have successfully diminished the  food poverty of program beneficiaries: average household income has risen and is 40% higher than the average income of non-beneficiaries. The cash transfers have also fostered the creation of small family businesses, and in 2018, nearly two-thirds of households had at least two small family-run income-generating activities. The program has resulted in a marked improvement in the human development and women’s empowerment indicators;32,000 households are receiving cash in return for community work347 health centers providing basic care have been renovated (installation of solar energy refrigerators to preserve vaccines, for example)Private sector developmentBetween 2015 and 2017, six reforms relating to improvement of the investment climate have been adopted and implemented, tangibly reducing barriers to entrepreneurship and to business growth.The total number of direct beneficiaries of the Second Integrated Growth Poles and Corridors Project (PIC2) is estimated at nearly 400,000In the 77 PIC2 intervention communes, there was an increase of 51% in commune-level revenues between 2015 and end-2016 and an increase of 85% in the number of newly formalized enterprises in the 77 PIC2 intervention communesPassenger traffic, including tourists traveling by air and sea, increased by 37% in the main PIC2 tourism centers.AgricultureMore than 58,000 hectares of irrigated land were rehabilitated. Rice production yields increased from 2.5 metric tons to close to five metric tons per hectare, bringing direct benefits to more than 76,000 agricultural householdsBetween 2017 and 2019, almost 100,000 farmers directly benefited from improved irrigation services and agricultural inputs300,250 land certificates have been registered since 2006EnergyAnnual electricity losses by the national power company, JIRAMA, have dropped by 5%The proportion of the population with access to electricity increased by 8% as a result of grid and off-grid solutions.Total electricity sales per kWh covered by the revenue protection program increased by 23%.Last Updated: Jul 31, 2020"

The return to constitutional order and peaceful political transition in  the last elections was instrumental to this economic revival, as it contributed to restore investor confidence, reopen access to key export markets, reinstate flows of concessional financing, and encourage structural reforms. These positive trends were also reflected in improved labor market conditions and declining poverty rates, although around 75% of the population was still estimated to live below the international poverty line of $1.90 in 2019, significantly higher than the regional average of 41%.The adverse economic, social, and fiscal impact of the COVID-19 crisis will be very substantial in 2020. Global trade and travel disruptions as well as domestic containment measures are expected to result in a sharp deceleration in economic activity in 2020, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth predicted to slow to 1.2%, compared to an estimated growth rate of 5.2% just prior to the outbreak. Vulnerable populations in urban areas are particularly exposed to economic hardship and poverty traps in these  circumstances. Sharply declining tax revenues and COVID-19-related spending will widen the fiscal deficit and create a sudden increase in financing needs. These developments emphasize the importance of implementing robust emergency measures to save lives, protect vulnerable populations, and safeguard jobs in the short term as well as accelerate reforms to stimulate investment for long-term recovery, strengthen resilience to future shocks, and maintain public debt at a sustainable course. The World Bank is committed to working with the government to achieve those objectives with the fully array of its instruments. Social Context and Development ChallengesThe country’s human capital index ranking is among the lowest worldwide, and Madagascar has the world’s fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition, with almost one child in two under five years of age suffering from stunting. An estimated 1.4 million children dropped out of primary school in 2012.Living conditions remain difficult for the vast majority of the population, with a low rate of access to electricity (13%) in particular.Madagascar is one of the African countries most severely affected by climate change impacts and experiences an average of three cyclones per year.

        The development partners are continuing their intensive cooperation with the Malagasy authorities.The World Bank is working hand in hand with the Agence française de développement  (AFD) and the Global Environment Facility on the Sustainable Landscape Management Project (Projet Agriculture Durable par une Approche Paysage PADAP) to halt the degradation of natural resources in Madagascar and improve access to irrigation systems, agricultural inputs, and agricultural and forestry services.With the program to combat chronic malnutrition in children in Madagascar using the new multiphase programmatic approach, the World Bank is working in association with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Health Organization,  UNICEF, the GAVI Alliance, the Power of Nutrition, the German international cooperation agency (GIZ), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to round out the interventions designed to improve nutritional indicators.The World Bank, various UN agencies, the European Union, and USAID provided support to the Malagasy Government to complete the third General Population and Housing Census in 2018.Furthermore, the African Development Bank and the World Bank are working together to assess and improve the Malagasy public procurement system so that it can be used in projects financed with international aid.

The country has strong macroeconomic institutions and it is open to trade.  Over the last three decades Mexico has underperformed in terms of growth, inclusion and poverty reduction compared to similar countries.   Its economic growth averaged just above 2 percent a year between 1980 and 2018, limiting progress in convergence relative to high income economies.Beyond the health and human life consequences, which are massive across countries, the COVID-19 pandemic brought demand and supply shocks to the Mexican economy with deep impacts on firms, employment, and households. The combination of the global recession (including a drop in U.S. output, Mexico’s main trading partner), disruptions in global and domestic supply chains, measures to flatten the contagion curve, financial disruptions and investment risk aversion, among other, are likely to take heavy toll on the key components of aggregate demand. In this context, a significant contraction of the economy is expected for 2020.

        The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Mexico was discussed by the World Bank Group (WBG) Board of Executive Directors on February 27, 2020. The CPF covers a six-year period (2020-2025) and aligns the WBG’s engagement with the government’s National Development Plan. The objectives remain relevant in the present context, allowing flexible and strategic adjustments to respond to the current supply and demand shocks.  It builds on the analysis of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and reflects the views and strategy of the authorities.

        Supporting women, rural finance inclusion, jobs, and poverty reduction in Mexico’s poorest states. Through a newly established network of private financial intermediaries (PFIs), the Expanding Rural Finance Project increases the availability of finance to rural MSMEs in areas where commercial banks have not been able to reach local producers. Limited access to finance is a bottleneck for growth and poverty reduction in Mexico. The gaps are particularly acute in rural areas, in poorer states of the country, and among certain groups of the population like women. This Project has helped to establish and/or improve credit, risk, and management capacity of more than 170 small PFIs located in rural areas. After four years of implementation, more than 180,000 loans have been delivered (average loan size of US$1,900), 70 percent in rural areas in the poorer states of the South, 80 percent to women, and 10 percent in communities classified as marginalized or highly marginalized by the National Council for Population. Rural MSMEs have benefited from improved access to finance and expanded economic activity, and the funding is helping PFIs reach more clients and grow their activities in rural areas with low levels of non-performing loans. Lending through PFIs and thus leveraging their distribution networks helps not only increase the Rural Financial Development Agency’s (FND in Spanish) reach of a difficult segment of the market. It also serves to promote inclusion, job creation, and support private sector supply of rural finance in Mexico’s poorest states while making them self-sustained over time. This experience can be passed on to other countries in which rural finance is limited and/or proved difficult to expand.

        Over the past 25 years, Mongolia has transformed into a vibrant democracy, tripling its GDP per capita since 1991. Primary school enrollments are at 97%, coupled with impressive declines in maternal and child mortality (45 per 100,000 live births in 2017 and 16 per 1,000 live births in 2018 respectively). With vast agricultural, livestock and mineral resources and an increasingly educated population, Mongolia’s development prospects look promising in the long-term assuming the continuation of structural reforms. After growing close to 6 percent on average in 2017-19, the  economy is likely to contract in 2020 amid adverse impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic and pre-existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. It would be the first contraction since the global financial crisis in 2009. The fiscal gains of the past three years are being rapidly eroded by unprecedented revenue losses (mainly driven by a large contraction in the trade flows) and spending increase (including health care costs and capex as well as fiscal relief measures). The government debt as a share of GDP is likely to rise again in 2020, reversing the downward trend of recent years. External sector pressures are likely to mount, due to weaker export earnings, lower foreign investments and health-related imports supported by the fiscal stimulus. A recent survey by the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce (MCC) indicated that about that about 8,000 jobs have been lost since the COVID-19 outbreak. This trend is likely to continue, contributing to further increase in unemployment rate and reversing recent progress on poverty reduction. In addition, inflation would probably remain under the central bank target mostly driven by weak domestic demand and lower oil prices,However, unless the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged locally and globally, growth is expected to accelerate in the medium term, largely supported by robust growth in private consumption and continued steady investment in mining and manufacturing. This prospect is predicated on the government’s continued commitment to fiscal consolidation to contain public debt in the medium term by improving revenue mobilization and controlling public spending once the impact of the COVID-19 shock on the economy wanes.Other risks to the outlook include lingering impact of the COVID-19, notably on the commodity market, climate shocks (drought/flooding, harsh winter), possible relaxation of the government’s commitment to reforms after the COVID-19 shock, uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of the U.S.A.-China trade deal and limited progress on banking sector reforms as well as on addressing anti-money laundering issues.Mongolia’s official national poverty rate has fluctuated since 2010. The poverty headcount rate declined sharply from 38.8% to 21.6% during the economic boom in 2010-2014. However, between 2016 and 2018, poverty reduction was uneven, declining in rural but not in urban areas. Growth in rural areas was faster and favorable to the poor, contributing to reducing rural poverty from 34.9% in 2016 to 30.8% in 2018 supported by rising livestock prices and expansion of poverty-targeted social protection programs.By contrast, the urban poverty rate remained unchanged at 27% from 2016 to 2018, mainly driven by stagnant wage growth in the poorest population group. Consequently, poverty is increasingly concentrated in urban areas. In the coming years, fiscally sustainable labor and poverty-targeted social protection policies coupled with a positive economic outlook will be key to reducing poverty.To ensure sustainable and inclusive growth and to reduce poverty, Mongolia will also need to strengthen governance; build institutional capacity to manage public revenues efficiently; allocate its resources effectively among spending, investing, and saving; and ensure equal opportunities to all its citizens in urban and rural areas.

In the coming years, fiscally sustainable labor and poverty-targeted social protection policies coupled with a positive economic outlook will be key to reducing poverty.To ensure sustainable and inclusive growth and to reduce poverty, Mongolia will also need to strengthen governance; build institutional capacity to manage public revenues efficiently; allocate its resources effectively among spending, investing, and saving; and ensure equal opportunities to all its citizens in urban and rural areas.

        Over the past 25 years, Mongolia has transformed into a vibrant democracy, tripling its GDP per capita since 1991. Primary school enrollments are at 97%, coupled with impressive declines in maternal and child mortality (45 per 100,000 live births in 2017 and 16 per 1,000 live births in 2018 respectively). With vast agricultural, livestock and mineral resources and an increasingly educated population, Mongolia’s development prospects look promising in the long-term assuming the continuation of structural reforms. After growing close to 6 percent on average in 2017-19, the  economy is likely to contract in 2020 amid adverse impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic and pre-existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. It would be the first contraction since the global financial crisis in 2009. The fiscal gains of the past three years are being rapidly eroded by unprecedented revenue losses (mainly driven by a large contraction in the trade flows) and spending increase (including health care costs and capex as well as fiscal relief measures). The government debt as a share of GDP is likely to rise again in 2020, reversing the downward trend of recent years. External sector pressures are likely to mount, due to weaker export earnings, lower foreign investments and health-related imports supported by the fiscal stimulus. A recent survey by the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce (MCC) indicated that about that about 8,000 jobs have been lost since the COVID-19 outbreak. This trend is likely to continue, contributing to further increase in unemployment rate and reversing recent progress on poverty reduction. In addition, inflation would probably remain under the central bank target mostly driven by weak domestic demand and lower oil prices,However, unless the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged locally and globally, growth is expected to accelerate in the medium term, largely supported by robust growth in private consumption and continued steady investment in mining and manufacturing. This prospect is predicated on the government’s continued commitment to fiscal consolidation to contain public debt in the medium term by improving revenue mobilization and controlling public spending once the impact of the COVID-19 shock on the economy wanes.Other risks to the outlook include lingering impact of the COVID-19, notably on the commodity market, climate shocks (drought/flooding, harsh winter), possible relaxation of the government’s commitment to reforms after the COVID-19 shock, uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of the U.S.A.-China trade deal and limited progress on banking sector reforms as well as on addressing anti-money laundering issues.Mongolia’s official national poverty rate has fluctuated since 2010. The poverty headcount rate declined sharply from 38.8% to 21.6% during the economic boom in 2010-2014. However, between 2016 and 2018, poverty reduction was uneven, declining in rural but not in urban areas. Growth in rural areas was faster and favorable to the poor, contributing to reducing rural poverty from 34.9% in 2016 to 30.8% in 2018 supported by rising livestock prices and expansion of poverty-targeted social protection programs.By contrast, the urban poverty rate remained unchanged at 27% from 2016 to 2018, mainly driven by stagnant wage growth in the poorest population group.

        Mongolia became a member of the World Bank in February 1991, and the World Bank will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Mongolia’s membership in 2021. Over the last three decades, the World Bank has provided more than US$1 billion in development financing to the country. As of August 2020, the Bank's portfolio in Mongolia has total commitments of $365.46 million, comprised of 13 operations financed by IDA/IBRD credits totaling $349.51 million, one co-financing grant totaling $12.40 million, and two recipient-executed trust fund operations totaling $3.55 million.  In addition to the lending operations and grants, the Bank also provides analytical and advisory services to Mongolia to support its medium- and long-term development objectives and to build the capacity for formulating and implementing strategic reforms.The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mongolia for 2013-2017 focused on three areas:Enhancing Mongolia’s capacity to manage the mining economy sustainably and transparently.Building a sustained and diversified basis for economic growth and employment in urban and rural areas.Addressing vulnerabilities through improved access to services and better service delivery, safety net provision, and improved disaster risk management.In 2018, the World Bank Group finalized the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) which identified key development challenges and priorities to eradicate poverty and promote shared prosperity in Mongolia. To ensure continuity of the World Bank Group’s program in Mongolia and in close consultation with the Mongolian authorities, this Performance and Learning Review (PLR) updates the current strategy and extends it until December 31, 2020. The World Bank Group is in the process of developing its next Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Mongolia in consultation with the stakeholders in government, private sector, and CSOs. The CPF will guide the WBG’s engagement in Mongolia until 2024 and is planned to be finalized in 2020.

        Since 1991, IDA has supported Mongolia in a range of areas, including rural development, education, Ulaanbaatar’s development, sound management of the mining sector, environmental protection and policy development.The overall goal of the rural program in Mongolia has been to reduce the vulnerability of herders to pastoral risk as well as to protect and extend gains made to provide relief in cases of climate emergencies, micro-finance, telecommunications and social services to rural residents. Between 2007 and 2013, the Rural Education and Development (READ) Project made learning materials available in rural Mongolia by establishing 3,560 classroom libraries in all 383 rural primary schools. Each school received over 160 books, benefiting a total of 130,000 students, and 4,144 rural primary teachers and 383 school directors were trained. A local professional development network has been set up consisting of 95 core schools and 178 mentor teachers.The Renewable Energy and Rural Electricity Access Project (REAP) helped the government of Mongolia complete its National 100,000 Solar Ger Electrification Program, which provided over half a million nomadic herders with access to electricity through portable solar home systems. The project also helped fund improvements in soum (district) electrification, including rehabilitating mini-grids and installing renewable energy technology hybrid systems to power them.In 2006, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project was launched initially in four aimags (provinces). In 2010, when another dzud hit Mongolia, it was expanded to cover all 21 aimags. This was the first time such a system was implemented in Mongolia or anywhere else in the world, where payments are based on the total number of livestock lost by species and soum (district) rather than on households’ actual, individual losses. Since the program started, insurance policies have become more and more popular among herders, with purchased policies increasing each year. After the project closed in 2015, the government continued to support index-based livestock insurance. The 2016-2017 sale season was the highest on record.Under the Livestock and Agricultural Management Project (LAMP), the government has improved rural livelihoods and food security through targeted investments to boost productivity, market access and diversification in livestock-based production systems. More than 200 subprojects in horticulture, value chain development, livestock health and breeding have been funded under the project, leading to increased household incomes and outputs of livestock products, better nutrition and jobs in 15 soums of 5 western aimags Zavkhan, Khuvsgul, Govi-Altai, Bayankhongor, and Arkhangai. Around 7,000 people have received training in livestock health, breeding, nutrition, horticulture, and environment management. The project was implemented through December 2017. Thanks to the Information Communications Infrastructure Development Project (ICIDP), all 330 soum centers (villages) in Mongolia received access to modern phone and Internet services, while 34 soum centers were connected to high-speed internet during the project implementation in 2005-2013. Herders started using mobile phones in their daily lives, and telephone call minutes made from outside of soum centers jumped from zero at the start of the project to about 530,000 annual minutes in 2012. The rate of Internet users in and outside soum centers continues to expand.   The government also improved the policy and regulatory environment and promoted investments in ICT in rural areas, which ensured continued additional annual investment in the ICT sector of the country – annual investment increased from $37.6 million in 2005 to $395 million in 2013.  A mechanism has been established to collect resources into a fund to finance universal access to telecommunication and Internet services.Improving Primary Education Outcomes for the Most Vulnerable Children in Rural Mongolia Project, funded by the Japan Social Development Fund, targeted rural nomadic herders’ children in 30 soums of four provinces. The project introduced a home-based school preparation program for herders’ children living in remote rural areas. The level of school readiness of the children enrolled in the program has been significantly higher than of those enrolled in other alternative preschool education programs.In addition, mobile toy and book libraries have been established in 30 soums, giving parents the opportunity to borrow and use high-quality education materials with their children at home. Extracurricular after-school programs, developed under the project, are helping primary grade rural children better adapt to school and dormitory environments. Overall, more than 7,500 children between 5-10 years, 15,000 parents, 500 teachers and soum officials have benefitted from the project.Governance Assistance Project (GAP), implemented from 2006–2014 with $14 million financing, helped improve the efficiency and effectiveness of governance processes in the management of public finances, promote transparency and accountability in the performance of public sector functions, and foster the investment climate in Mongolia. The project was designed around five principal intervention areas: debt management, budget execution, tax administration, public procurement, and mineral resource management.Overall, the project contributed to an improved investment climate, reduced corruption, and increased government accountability as reflected in improved perceptions of corruption in tax administration and public procurement, expanded taxpayer registration, better public access to budget information, and increased competition in procurement. It also contributed to building capacity on core government functions.Last year, the Second Economic Management Support Operation (EMSO2)  Development Policy Financing (DPF) was approved with US$100 million financing. The program aims to support the government in restoring debt sustainability, strengthening the social protection system, and enhancing competitiveness.In addition to lending projects, the World Bank also provided technical assistance and produced analytical reports to help inform policy and stimulate public debate.

        The COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated rapidly since the end of the lockdown Morocco imposed in March. As a result, the months of August and September saw a spike in coronavirus cases, with the Casablanca-Settat region largely dominating the daily COVID contamination scores, and the city of Casablanca and other COVID hotbeds often subject to temporary lockdown measures. By October 14, Morocco had recorded over 2,700 coronavirus deaths and more than 160,000 confirmed cases of infection. The government’s state-of-health emergency, in force since mid-March, has been extended to November 10. In his August address to the nation, King Mohammed VI warned Morocco could return to total lockdown if the upward trend of coronavirus infections continued.At the end of July, the King had announced a new roadmap to boost recovery and spur inclusive growth, inviting the government to develop a plan to meet its objectives. These include: health coverage for all Moroccans within a 5-year timeframe; the expansion of social welfare to vulnerable segments of the population; the reform of state-owned enterprises; and bold measures to boost recovery, including the setting up of a strategic investment fund worth US$4.8 billion to help enterprises and individuals recover from the impact of the coronavirus. On August 4, the government unveiled a detailed plan to address these priorities.In parallel, the Commission for the New Development Model (established in December 2019) is continuing to work on forging a path for Morocco’s long-term development. The coronavirus—and the implications it has on the country’s development model and economic trajectory—means the monarchy has given the Commission an extra 6 months (up to December 2020) to deliver it.To help Morocco cope with the effects of COVID-19, the World Bank restructured, in April 2020, a US$275 million Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan, with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO). This added a health-related trigger to allow immediate funding for emergency measures. In addition, in June 2020, the World Bank granted a US$48 million loan to support the government health sector’s response to COVID-19 by strengthening measures of prevention for infection, as well as its detection, surveillance, and case management.On the economic front, the COVID-19 shock has pushed the Moroccan economy abruptly into a severe recession—the first recession since 1995. Economic output contracted by 13.8% in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the lockdown but also because of a sharp reduction in exports caused by the disruption of global value chains, collapse of tourism receipts, and a fall in remittances. The shocks to supply and demand triggered by the pandemic have been compounded by the underperformance of the agricultural sector as a result of an unusually dry winter. In this context, in H1-2020 the unemployment rate increased from 8.1% to 12.3%. The Moroccan authorities have adopted a number of measures to mitigate the impact of these shocks on households and companies, including: direct transfers to formal and informal workers; issuing partial guarantees to banks for loans granted to firms; a reduction in the Central Bank’s benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points (to a historically low 1.5%); and direct injections of liquidity into the financial system.The COVID shock is leading to an amplification of Morocco’s twin deficits, thus increasing the country’s financing needs. The fiscal consolidation efforts undertaken by the authorities in recent years have been discontinued as current expenditure on health and social protection have had to be increased substantially to respond to the pandemic. Recession has resulted in a shortfall of tax revenues, mainly from customs duties, goods and services, income and profits—all of which will increase the budget deficit. On the external front, Morocco’s open economy is highly exposed to international shocks and especially to adverse developments in the eurozone area. During the first half of 2020, a sharp decrease—in remittances (-8.1%), tourism (-33.2%), and exports (-18.3%)—has had an adverse impact on the country’s current account.Real GDP is projected to contract by 6.3% in 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic but also to poor rain. In turn, the fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 7.6% of GDP in 2020 which, together with the recession, will result in a substantial increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Finally, the decline in exports, tourism receipts, and remittances could increase the current account deficit to 9.9% of GDP. In line with the rest of the world, the Moroccan economy is expected to rebound in 2021, something that should help contain the budget and current account deficits. The pace and length of recovery are, however, subject to a high degree of uncertainty, related to the epidemiological evolution of the pandemic and the future performance of Morocco’s main trading partners.

        The COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated rapidly since the end of the lockdown Morocco imposed in March. As a result, the months of August and September saw a spike in coronavirus cases, with the Casablanca-Settat region largely dominating the daily COVID contamination scores, and the city of Casablanca and other COVID hotbeds often subject to temporary lockdown measures. By October 14, Morocco had recorded over 2,700 coronavirus deaths and more than 160,000 confirmed cases of infection. The government’s state-of-health emergency, in force since mid-March, has been extended to November 10. In his August address to the nation, King Mohammed VI warned Morocco could return to total lockdown if the upward trend of coronavirus infections continued.At the end of July, the King had announced a new roadmap to boost recovery and spur inclusive growth, inviting the government to develop a plan to meet its objectives. These include: health coverage for all Moroccans within a 5-year timeframe; the expansion of social welfare to vulnerable segments of the population; the reform of state-owned enterprises; and bold measures to boost recovery, including the setting up of a strategic investment fund worth US$4.8 billion to help enterprises and individuals recover from the impact of the coronavirus. On August 4, the government unveiled a detailed plan to address these priorities.In parallel, the Commission for the New Development Model (established in December 2019) is continuing to work on forging a path for Morocco’s long-term development. The coronavirus—and the implications it has on the country’s development model and economic trajectory—means the monarchy has given the Commission an extra 6 months (up to December 2020) to deliver it.To help Morocco cope with the effects of COVID-19, the World Bank restructured, in April 2020, a US$275 million Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan, with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO). This added a health-related trigger to allow immediate funding for emergency measures.

        Morocco is at a turning point in its history relating to its potential to create high, inclusive growth and take advantage of positive trends in Moroccan society, including urbanization and demographic transition. The World Bank Country Partnership Framework for Morocco (CPF) has been designed to support Morocco’s efforts to navigate this. Leveraging the combined strengths of the IBRD, IFC, and MIGA, the CPF incorporates the objectives of INDH (National Initiative for Human Development) and the government’s program and Medium-Term Strategy 2017–21, all of which aim to improve social cohesion and social and territorial disparity. The CPF covering the fiscal years 2019 to 2024 contains the overarching goal of improving the conditions for growth and job creation but pursuing three, strategic focus areas: (A) Promoting Job Creation by the Private Sector; (B) Strengthening Human Capital; and, (C) Promoting Inclusive and Resilient Territorial Development.Governance and Citizen Engagement are the foundational principles of the CPF, and Gender and Digital Technology are cross-cutting themes. These complement each other: Private sector-led job creation, pivotal to more productivity and competitiveness, will help Morocco create a business environment that supports the development of micro-, small, and medium enterprises while attracting more foreign investment and increasing the employability of the country’s youth. This will be be enabled by new, government-led reforms and supported by IFC through investment in financial inclusion, MSME finance, Fintech, and capital markets. IFC is already investing US$4.3 million for financial sector infrastructure and advisory services in Morocco. Private sector-led job creation requires key competencies to meet the demands of an increasingly competitive job market. Strengthening the country’s human capital is critical to meet this objective. The CPF focuses on interventions that improve outcomes in education and health, promote early childhood development, and establish innovative social protection programs, all within an integrated targeting system. IFC investments are expected to focus on innovative private sector solutions for employability and critical healthcare, again to be enabled by new reforms.The focus area dedicated to promoting inclusive and resilient territorial development will strengthen services and infrastructure, water resources management, and spatially targeted interventions, wherever needed. Governance and Citizen Engagement are to be mainstreamed across the portfolio, their emphasis on improved resources management, transparency, and building citizen capacity to engage the government and monitor the progress of public sector programs. Investment from IFC is intended to help introduce a new model for municipal financing to leverage private sector funding: the first such investment of US$100 million has been made in the Casablanca-Settat region to expand its tramway and upgrade rural roads.The CPF features digitalization as a cross-cutting theme: Transitioning to digital platforms in government, finance, and public services will help Morocco develop new drivers of growth by supporting digital entrepreneurship, e-transactions, and e-government. Empowering women and girls to share in prosperity—the other key cross-cutting theme for our engagement in Morocco—is at the forefront of the CPF’s objectives. World Bank support contributes to addressing the constraints young women face in accessing both the labor market and finance and in strengthening their business and entrepreneurial skills.  Since the World Bank Board of the Executive Directors reviewed the CPF in February 2019, the following projects have been approved:Community-Based Rural Roads Maintenance (US$2.85 million): approved in May 2019, this small but high-impact Trust Fund project aims to provide opportunities for disadvantaged rural inhabitants to improve their livelihoods and maintain the accessibility and usability of targeted rural roads in the project’s area.Supporting the economic inclusion of youth (US$55 million), approved in May 2019. The project development objective is to increase access to economic opportunities for youth in the project area.Education Support Program (US$500 million), approved in June 2019. The project’s objectives are to establish an enabling environment for quality early childhood education service delivery, support improved teaching practices in primary and secondary education,and strengthen management capacity and accountability along the education service delivery chain in the Program Areas.The Municipal Performance Project, of €271.8 million (US$300 million) was approved on November, 2019. It is part of the Kingdom of Morocco’s broader efforts to upgrade urban services and turn urban conglomerations into engines of growth and job creation. The project aims to build capacity by providing a sustainable, performance-based framework for municipalities to work with.Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (US$275 million), approved in December 2019. The objective of the project is to support the Government of Morocco in: (a) strengthening the country’s institutional capacity to deal with the adverse financial impacts of disasters and climate-related shocks: and, (b) strengthening Morocco's institutional framework for disaster and climate-related risk management.First Financial and Digital Inclusion Development Policy Financing (US$500 million), approved in June 2020. The overarching Development Objective of the proposed DPF series is to improve financial inclusion, digital entrepreneurship, and access to digital infrastructure and services for individuals and businesses, and to strengthen the resilience of households and firms.Last Updated: Oct 01, 2020"

        Prior to the impacts of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic and, despite economic growth lost momentum in the last years, Panama has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6 percent over the last five years.The effects of the pandemic on the Panamanian economy are expected to be significant, with main macroeconomic indicators affected.

        The World Bank (IBRD) financing helped achieved the following results from 2008 to 2020:Support for the National Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. Designed jointly with the Panama’s Indigenous communities and the government of Panama, especially women and youth who are the most excluded populations. It supports the investments proposed by the traditional authorities focused on access, quality and cultural pertinence of service delivery in health, education, and water and sanitation. It also includes investments to improve governance capacity, planning and coordination between Indigenous Authorities and the Government of Panama with a vision to contribute to breaching some of the largest levels of ethnic based inequalities that exist in the region. The project has had the following results: first, passing an Executive Decree to legally formalize the National Indigenous Peoples Development Council; second, the acceptance by the traditional Indigenous Authorities to include a woman advisor as part of each delegation that participates on the Council; and purchase of sanitary supplies earmarked to indigenous regions in response to the COVID-19 emergency.Economic Empowerment of Indigenous Women. The trust fund supported a demand and supply study for indigenous women's economic empowerment in Panama. Furthermore, it also supported a pilot intervention in six communities that responded to the results of the study to support ecosystem development, financial inclusion, and technical assistance for women producers. The analysis demonstrated that, even though indigenous women earn 70 percent less than non-indigenous Panamanian women, there are no existing programs in their communities that target their economic empowerment. Numerous programs exist to support technical assistance for indigenous productive activities, and of these some have extended benefits to indigenous women, but none have been designed to address the unique realities and constraints faced by indigenous women who require access to internet, computers and the ability to spend significant time in Panama City.Increased Income and Productive Capacity of Small-Scale Producers. Financing and technical assistance for access to markets was provided to 152 productive alliances of small-scale producers in high-poverty areas, including indigenous areas. Producers benefitted from increased agricultural productivity and a 23 percent increase in sales. Around 4,600 producers (30 percent women) received investment and technical support through 130 sub-projects covering a range of agricultural activities.Improved Targeting of Social Transfer Programs and Increased Social Security Coverage. By improving the targeting of the Red de Oportunidades program (translated as “Network of Opportunities”), the Government channeled resources to the poor in remote geographic areas, largely excluded in the past, increasing coverage in the indigenous comarcas (50 to 70 percent from 2008 to 2014) which represented 46 percent of beneficiary households. Currently, with the objective of supporting the Government of Panama with social protection activities in response to COVID-19, the project supports conditional cash transfer programs (Red de Oportunidades, Programa 120 a los 65, Programa Ángel Guardián) in order to address the economic and social emergency by protecting the poorest and most vulnerable.Improved Households Access to Quality Basic Health and Nutrition Services. Through the provision of a basic package of health services under the Coverage Extension Strategy, mobile health units provided regular access to a basic package of health services to 149,028 beneficiaries from 47 poor rural communities by 2014, with 86 percent of pregnant women receiving at least three prenatal controls (compared to 20 percent in 2010), and 96 percent of children under age one receiving full vaccinations (compared to 26 percent in 2010).Increased access to sustainable water supplies and sanitation services for communities in rural and poor urban areas. More than 25,000 beneficiaries in rural communities got newly constructed latrines. In addition, the use of performance-based contracting helped improve quality, coverage, and efficiency of water supply services in lower-income neighborhoods in Colon – the continuity of service provision increased from 13 to 71 percent from 2014 to 2017), piped water services were extended to 2,115 households, and the commercial efficiency of the National Water and Sewer Agency’s Colon regional office improved.Enhanced Capacity for Disaster Risk Management and Adaptation to Climate Change. The Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Risk Deferred Drawdown Option has been a quick and flexible instrument in addressing a national drought emergency triggered by El Niño phenomenon (2015-2016), including support to the Water Security High Level Committee in the development and implementation of the National Water Security Plan. Most of the World Bank disaster risk management support has been provided through technical assistance activities with key results including the development of the first Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Framework in Latin America, and a strengthened emergency preparedness and response capacity at the subnational level. In March 2020, through the resources available from CAT DDO, US$ 41 million were disbursed in order to expand the health care network in response to the COVID-19.Improved Budget Management Transparency. In 2016, the Government began channeling funds for 181 budgetary account of 21 central government entities through the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), and in 2017, incorporated 347 budgetary accounts of all 24 central government institutions. The consolidation of the TSA was complemented by the roll-out of a new integrated financial management information system, ISTMO (for its Spanish acronym), in all central government entities and its expansion to 32 of the 36 decentralized institutions. In addition, the WB Treasury’s support to Panama’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fondo de Ahorro de Panamá) has built capacity and supported the development and approval of an investment policy for Panama’s sovereign assets that focuses on growth assets over the medium-to long-term.Improved effectiveness in the management of protected areas in Panama and the Conservation of Globally Significant Biodiversity. The project impact 152,119 direct beneficiaries (47% women) through 30 sub-projects supporting income-generating and biodiversity-friendly production and marketing system implemented by producer associations. Management effectiveness was  improved in nine protected areas with more than 645,015 ha brought under biodiversity protection and 1,611 hectares of cocoa, plantain, and coffee plantations of landscape certified by internationally/nationally recognized standards  An endowment fund to support sustainable management of protected areas was established and operating with an initial capitalization of US$ 5.0 million (now standing at US$ 20.3 million) to support sustainable management of protected areas, as part of one window of the broader national fund for water, protected areas and forest (“Super Fund”).Increased reliability of energy supply.  Using Development Policy Financing (DPF), the IBRD has supported a changing policy environment which ushered in new, better targeted tariff subsidies and established incentives to increase the share of renewable energy in the power generation matrix. These efforts were complemented by IFC’s advisory services to increase energy efficiency through the implementation of a Green Building Code, as well as investments and Technical Assistances (TA) to ramp up hydroelectric, wind, and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) projects. Together, policy changes, TA, and investments, support efforts to improve the reliability of the energy system for Panamanians, while also displacing the use of heavy fuel and diesel and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.COVID-19 Emergency Response Project. In response to the threats generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank enabled a rapid response package (“Rapid Response Mechanism”) to help countries prepare and address health, social and economic impact of the global outbreak. The project finances key medical supplies for the prevention, detection and treatment of COVID-19.

        Some of the key projects and programs funded by the World Bank Group (WBG) include the Rwanda Quality Basic Education for Human Capital Development Project( $200 million); the  Rwanda Energy Sector Development Policy Operation  ($125million); the Priority Skills for Growth ($150 million); the Rwanda Housing Finance Project ($150 million); and the Strengthening Social Protection Project ($103 million).  Expanded Access to ElectricityThe Bank has been the leading financier of the flagship grid electrification program, Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP), contributing more than $170 million to the country’s electrification agenda through Rwanda Electricity Access Scale Up and Sector Wide Approach Development Project and the Rwanda Electricity Sector Strengthening Project (RESSP). Through consistent and well-planned implementation of EARP, Rwanda has increased its electricity access from 9% in 2009 to 47% in February 2019, with the World Bank supporting electrification agenda not with just financing infrastructure investments but also contributing to development of the electrification prospectus, crowding in contributions of other donors and maintaining constant technical dialogue with Rwanda Energy Group (REG). The World Bank is also supporting off-grid electrification in Rwanda through a $50 million Renewable Energy Fund, funded by Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program and implemented by the Development Bank of Rwanda.Additionally, the Rwanda Energy Sector Development Policy Loan series ($375 million over three years) is supporting the electricity sector reform program of the Government of Rwanda that aims at putting Rwanda’s electricity sector on low-carbon, financially sustainable and affordable path. Strengthening Social ProtectionThrough the Social Protection System Project, the Bank has helped expand the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP), the government’s flagship social protection program. Overall, different components of VUP benefit more than one million individuals in all the targeted households in the following ways: Direct support (cash transfers) grew from 6,850 households in 2009, to cover the entire country with 107,106 households as of 2019, over 71% of which are headed by women. A classic public works program grew from 30 sectors with 18,304 households in 2008 to 244 sectors (out of 416 sectors in the country) and is currently benefiting 133,102 households, of which 50% are headed by women. The Expanded Public Works Component (ePW), which offers a flexible, year-round work schedule to moderately labor-constrained households caring for children, was introduced in 2016/2017 and currently covers 150  administrative sectors with 22,583 households, more than 72% of them headed by women. Within ePW, a new type of employment was recently introduced, namely childcare in Home and Community Based Childcare, also supported through the ongoing Investment Project Financing instrument. Through the in Home and Community Based Childcare component, the Nutrition Sensitive Direct Support was introduced, a conditional cash transfer targeted to poorest households (approximately 60,000 households in 13 districts) with pregnant women and/or children under two, with a co-responsibility to uptake health and nutrition services. These two latest innovations made the VUP’s more gender and child-sensitive. Enhancing Infrastructure for Urban DevelopmentThrough the Rwanda Urban Development Project (RUDP), the World Bank is supporting Rwanda to provide access to basic infrastructure and enhance urban management in secondary cities and City of Kigali. Since the start of the project in 2016, nearly 65,000 people have benefited of whom more than half are women, and include the following results:   At its midpoint of implementation, RUDP has successfully completed the first phase of investments in urban roads (28.3km) and stand-alone drainage (13.8km) across six secondary cities. Supported these cities to draft and endorse Local Economic Development (LED) strategies with which they can guide local economic activities and private investments, as well as prioritizing their public investments. In City of Kigali, the project supports the upgrading of 86ha unplanned settlement in Nyarugenge District which is home to almost 1,900 people by providing access streets, footpaths, drainage and street lighting.

        Located in the most western part of Africa, Senegal is bordered by Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and Mauritania and surrounds its much smaller Anglophone neighbor, Gambia. With its tropical and dry climate, Senegal is home to 15.4 million people, a quarter of whom live in the region of the capital Dakar on 0.3% of the territory. Political Context Senegal is among Africa’s most stable countries, with three major peaceful political transitions since independence in 1960. The February 2019 presidential election saw President Macky Sall win a second term. He has been in office since 2012, but his second term will be shorter due to a March 2016 referendum that reduced the presidential term from seven to five years.  In 2017, the ruling coalition Benno Bokk Yakaar party (“United in Hope\" in the widely-spoken Wolof language) won 125 of 165 seats of the national assembly. A dozen other parties also hold seats. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, local and legislative elections could be twinned in 2022. Senegal has so far been spared regional security shocks, but activism by terrorist groups in neighboring countries and cross-border traffic are factors that risk fueling instability. Economic Overview Senegal’s economic growth has been among the highest in Africa between 2014 and 2018, remaining above 6% annually. GDP growth was 5.3% in 2019, down from 6.3% in 2017. The services sector continues to be the largest contributor to GDP growth, while on the demand side, investment (+12.5%) and exports (+7.2%) were the strongest growth drivers.  Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed Senegal's economic outlook. Growth has slowed significantly to an estimated 1.3% percent in 2020, with services (such as tourism and transport) and exports particularly hard hit. Senegal has responded with containment measures and a comprehensive economic stimulus plan (PRES) to protect lives and livelihoods. However, limited fiscal buffers and safety nets, a vulnerable healthcare system, and a large informal sector pose challenges. Economic recovery will likely be gradual, driven by a robust return of private consumption and investment. Reforms envisioned under the Senegal Emerging Plan (PSE) need to be deepened for growth to resume its pre-pandemic trajectory. Significant crowding in of private investment is central to increasing Senegal’s productive capacity and supporting export growth. Services remain the main contributor to GDP, and the primary sector (agriculture, in particular) the most dynamic growth driver. Oil and gas developments have been delayed due to COVID-19 and are expected to contribute to revenues and exports only around 2025. Development challenges: Senegal’s key development challenge is to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 while enabling sustainable and inclusive long-term growth, characterized by the following:  Improving resilience to macro-fiscal, environmental, and social risks to safeguard investments in human capital and household livelihood Boosting and protecting human capital for productivity growth Enhancing competitiveness and job creation through improving digital and physical connectivity at the national and regional levels, increasing efficiency of labor markets, lowering energy costs and carbon footprint and optimizing the energy mix, promoting the service economy, and  boosting the productivity and competitiveness of agriculture and related value chains  Social context The COVID-19 pandemic risks jeopardizing  welfare gains achieved through improved access to key services and connectivity,  in terms of both affordability and infrastructure deployment. This could generate severe welfare losses for households through shortfalls in labor and non-labor income (particularly private money transfers), domestic prices inflation, and disruptions in basic services.

        Macroeconomic ContextAfter slowing to 3.5% in 2018 from 3.8% in the previous year, economic growth in Sierra Leone is projected to rebound to 4.8% in 2019 driven by increased activities in agriculture and construction as well as the resumption of iron ore production and exports. Growth in these labor-intensive sectors could make a dent on poverty which remains widespread in the country (more than half of the population lives in poverty, according to the latest Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey (SLIHS)). The SLIHS 2018 will inform in the next few months the evolution of poverty in the country since 2011. Agriculture will continue to drive the non-iron ore gross domestic product (GDP) growth, with the sector expected to grow by 4.2% in 2019, spurred by increased investments and expansion in the crops, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors. The growth in services is expected to slow due to weaker performance in tourism, transportation and communication.The macroeconomic situation remained challenging during the first half of 2019 (2019H1) as inflationary pressure and exchange rate depreciation increased. Inflation, which moderated from 18.2 to 16.8% in 2018, increased to 17.2% in 2019H1 reflecting a sharp depreciation of exchange rate and elevated nonfood prices due mainly to the increase in fuel prices. The Leone came under intense pressure in 2019H1, depreciating by 4.8% and 6.5% (YoY) at the official and parallel markets, respectively, reflecting lower-than-expected export receipts and donor inflows as well as increased demand for foreign exchange to finance imports.The fiscal deficit will continue to improve as the government strengthens its fiscal consolidation measures. The overall fiscal deficit will narrow from 5.7% of GDP to 3.4% due mainly to increased revenue mobilization and expenditure management. Total revenue is expected to increase from 14.9% of GDP to 15.7% in 2019 as the government continues to implement its medium-term revenue mobilization strategy, which includes automation of customs documentation and tax processes and improving the operations of the treasury single account. Tax revenues are therefore expected to increase to 14.0% of GDP from 13.7% in the previous year.Total public debt is estimated to increase from 60.9% of GDP in 2018 to 62.3% of GDP in 2019, reflecting depreciation of the exchange rate as well as increased domestic debt on account of the conversion of stock of arrears into debt. The country remains at a “high risk” of debt distress for both external public debt and overall public debt. The current account deficit of the balance of payments is expected to narrow to 11.4% of GDP in 2019 helped by the slowdown in imports, which will more than offset the continued sluggish exports. Gross external reserves increased slightly to US$500m (3.4 months of import) in 2019H1 from $483m in 2018 (3.3 months of import).Political ContextSierra Leone held general elections on March 7, 2018 to elect a new President, Members of Parliament and Local Councils in the fourth cycle of elections since the civil war in 2002. The opposition Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP) candidate, Rtd. Brig. Julius Maada Bio won by 0.6 percentage points and for the first time a winning party failed to have majority in Parliament. The losing All People’s Congress (APC) had 68 seats (52%) and the SLPP had 49 seats (37%). Two new parties – the Coalition for Change (C4C) and the National Grand Coalition (NGC) – won eight and four seats respectively.However, the ruling party petitioned the election of 16 opposition MPs and the High Court ruled in its favor, nullifying the election of 10 – the seats of eight were awarded to the ruling party while two were to be re-run. The ruling party won the re-run in Constituency 040 held on September 14, while the opposition won a by-election in Constituency 043. The ruling party now has a majority with 59 seats and the main opposition has 58 seats. One re-run by-election is pending, the outcome of which may produce an equal number of representatives (59-59 should the opposition win) or add to the ruling party’s majority (60 if it wins).The government early this year launched three Commissions of Inquiry to probe into the governance activities of the past administration: 2007-2018. Persons of Interest include former president, vice presidents, ministers, deputies, and other civil and public servants. The Commissions are expected to conclude hearings by end of October with recommendations presented to government by end of 2019.Development ChallengesUntil the outbreak of Ebola in May 2014, Sierra Leone was seeking to attain middle-income status by 2035, but the country still carries its post-conflict attributes of high youth unemployment, corruption and weak governance. The country continues to face the daunting challenge of enhancing transparency in managing its natural resources and creating fiscal space for development. Problems of poor infrastructure and widespread rural and urban impoverishment persist despite remarkable strides and reforms.

        The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covered FY10 – FY13 done jointly with the International Finance Corporation and the African Development Bank. The CAS Progress Report was completed in June 2012. The three pillars combined from both documents are: (i) Strengthening the regulatory and institutional capacity in the extractives sector; (ii) Economic diversification through private sector development and establishment of “growth poles”; and (iii) Infrastructure for the extractives sector.Sierra Leone’s new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) will cover the period FY20-FY25. It presents a unique opportunity to support the government’s vision. The structure of the CPF is around three focus areas: (i) Human Capital Acceleration, (ii) Economic Diversification and Competitiveness, and (iii) Governance, Institutions and Resilience. This is consistent with the government’s new National Development Plan (NDP) launched on February 28, 2019. Consultations with various stakeholders including CSOs, private sector, central and local government, Parliament, development partners, media had been undertaken in different parts of the country.The current International Development Assocation portfolio in Sierra Leone stands at $597 million (credits and grants) covering 13 national and three regional operations with an undisbursed balance of $305 million (51%). Energy and Extractives account for 28% of the portfolio; Health, nutrition and population 27%; followed by transport and social protection and jobs at 8% each.The IDA18 resource envelope for Sierra Leone is approximately $320 million, all of which is expected to be delivered by the end of FY19.

The SLIHS 2018 will inform in the next few months the evolution of poverty in the country since 2011. Agriculture will continue to drive the non-iron ore gross domestic product (GDP) growth, with the sector expected to grow by 4.2% in 2019, spurred by increased investments and expansion in the crops, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors. The growth in services is expected to slow due to weaker performance in tourism, transportation and communication.The macroeconomic situation remained challenging during the first half of 2019 (2019H1) as inflationary pressure and exchange rate depreciation increased. Inflation, which moderated from 18.2 to 16.8% in 2018, increased to 17.2% in 2019H1 reflecting a sharp depreciation of exchange rate and elevated nonfood prices due mainly to the increase in fuel prices. The Leone came under intense pressure in 2019H1, depreciating by 4.8% and 6.5% (YoY) at the official and parallel markets, respectively, reflecting lower-than-expected export receipts and donor inflows as well as increased demand for foreign exchange to finance imports.The fiscal deficit will continue to improve as the government strengthens its fiscal consolidation measures. The overall fiscal deficit will narrow from 5.7% of GDP to 3.4% due mainly to increased revenue mobilization and expenditure management. Total revenue is expected to increase from 14.9% of GDP to 15.7% in 2019 as the government continues to implement its medium-term revenue mobilization strategy, which includes automation of customs documentation and tax processes and improving the operations of the treasury single account. Tax revenues are therefore expected to increase to 14.0% of GDP from 13.7% in the previous year.Total public debt is estimated to increase from 60.9% of GDP in 2018 to 62.3% of GDP in 2019, reflecting depreciation of the exchange rate as well as increased domestic debt on account of the conversion of stock of arrears into debt. The country remains at a “high risk” of debt distress for both external public debt and overall public debt. The current account deficit of the balance of payments is expected to narrow to 11.4% of GDP in 2019 helped by the slowdown in imports, which will more than offset the continued sluggish exports. Gross external reserves increased slightly to US$500m (3.4 months of import) in 2019H1 from $483m in 2018 (3.3 months of import).Political ContextSierra Leone held general elections on March 7, 2018 to elect a new President, Members of Parliament and Local Councils in the fourth cycle of elections since the civil war in 2002. The opposition Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP) candidate, Rtd. Brig. Julius Maada Bio won by 0.6 percentage points and for the first time a winning party failed to have majority in Parliament. The losing All People’s Congress (APC) had 68 seats (52%) and the SLPP had 49 seats (37%). Two new parties – the Coalition for Change (C4C) and the National Grand Coalition (NGC) – won eight and four seats respectively.However, the ruling party petitioned the election of 16 opposition MPs and the High Court ruled in its favor, nullifying the election of 10 – the seats of eight were awarded to the ruling party while two were to be re-run. The ruling party won the re-run in Constituency 040 held on September 14, while the opposition won a by-election in Constituency 043. The ruling party now has a majority with 59 seats and the main opposition has 58 seats. One re-run by-election is pending, the outcome of which may produce an equal number of representatives (59-59 should the opposition win) or add to the ruling party’s majority (60 if it wins).The government early this year launched three Commissions of Inquiry to probe into the governance activities of the past administration: 2007-2018. Persons of Interest include former president, vice presidents, ministers, deputies, and other civil and public servants. The Commissions are expected to conclude hearings by end of October with recommendations presented to government by end of 2019.Development ChallengesUntil the outbreak of Ebola in May 2014, Sierra Leone was seeking to attain middle-income status by 2035, but the country still carries its post-conflict attributes of high youth unemployment, corruption and weak governance. The country continues to face the daunting challenge of enhancing transparency in managing its natural resources and creating fiscal space for development. Problems of poor infrastructure and widespread rural and urban impoverishment persist despite remarkable strides and reforms.

        Revitalizing Education Development in Sierra Leone Project (ReDISL) – $31.37 million: Through this project, detailed data on school profile (students, teachers, facilities) and geo-coordinates is now available for decision making; Performance-Based Financing (PBF) yields improvement in teacher attendance between 2016 and 2018. Nationally, teacher attendance increased by five percentage points between September 2016 and February 2018. The 2018 results show that, on comparable indicators, PBF schools are performing better than non-PBF schools. The PBF design is set up to stimulate good practices in schools thereby improving the learning environment. There are fewer makeshift classrooms in PBF schools compared to non-PBF schools; PBF schools have greater engagement with mothers’ clubs compared to non-PBF schools; and the PBF schools support school management committees (SMCs) in training more than non-PBF schools.Social Safety Net Program – $17 million: The Bank supports the Government’s flagship Social Safety Net Program (SSNP) with $17m. The program currently benefits 30,453 extremely poor households with quarterly cash transfers, including beneficiaries temporarily covered under the Ebola immediate recovery period. 94% of the beneficiaries are women drawn from 12 out of the 16 districts in the country.Energy Sector Utility Reform Project (ESURP) – $40 million: has made a lot of progress in laying the foundation for improving the performance of the Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA)-both technical and financial. During the last two years, the total technical and commercial losses have been reduced to around 36% from about 40% and the overall collection rate has increased from about 78% to about 85%. But the aggregate technical, commercial, and collection losses are still over 45% and are much higher than the average losses of 20–25% in many Sub-Saharan Africa countries. A data and information system that can provide a more reliable tool for monitoring and assessing the technical and financial performance of EDSA has largely been put in place. The reliability of the distribution network has improved in terms of average duration of outages per month and average interruption frequency per year. This is achieved through frequent diagnose and analysis of the system and timely and preventive maintenance measures.Smallholder Commercialization and Agribusiness Development Project (SCADEP): This is a $40 million project that seeks to promote smallholder commercialization by fostering productive business linkages between smallholder farmers and selected agribusiness firms and other commodity off-takers in Sierra Leone. Project performance has been satisfactory. With the support to nine agribusinesses, the project is reaching 38,000 smallholders who are being supported to cultivate 46,982ha with improved planting materials. The first harvests of some 7,707ha farms of some of the beneficiary smallholders are expected in the next couple of months. And in improving access to markets, the project has so far completed the rehabilitation and maintenance of 166.5km of feeder roads for the 77 communities located along the corridor of the roads in nine districts. As a result, average travel time has seen significant reduction from over 20min/km to about 2min/km, and the communities that were hitherto cut-off during the rains are having year-round road access to farms, markets, schools, health centers, etc.Moreover, the project has completed the identification, prioritization and design with bidding documents prepared for 516.32km roads to be rehabilitated and maintained. So far, the total number of direct project beneficiaries reached stands at 8,837 smallholders of which 3,093 are women.

        CONTEXTTanzania’s solid macroeconomic performance during the past six years is being put to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the poverty rate in the country has declined, the absolute number of poor citizens has not because of the high population growth rate. The country's overall population is about 58 million (2019).  Political ContextIn October 2015, H.E John Pombe Magufuli was elected the fifth president of the United Republic of Tanzania. Magufuli’s Fifth-Phase Government has prioritized efforts to clampdown on corruption, improve public administration and manage public resources for improved social outcomes. The 2020 Worldwide Governance Indicators show Tanzania has either deteriorated or has been stagnant in all governance indicators between 2012 and 2019 (except for control of corruption). The strongest decline has been in voice and accountability, in political stability/violence and rule of law. On October 28, 2020, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held both in mainland Tanzania and in the semi-autonomous region of Zanzibar.Economic OverviewReflecting strong income growth over the past decade, on July 1, 2020 the World Bank announced that Tanzania’s gross national income (GNI) per capita increased from $1,020 in 2018 to $1,080 in 2019, exceeding the threshold for lower-middle income status. The country’s broad vision of its development goals as a middle-income country in 2025 are set out in the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, characterized by high-quality livelihoods; peace, stability, and unity; good governance; a well-educated and learning society; and a competitive economy capable of sustainable growth and shared benefits. Increased GNI per capita is impressive but not enough to reach these goals. Investing in both human development and physical capital is key to achieving these broad goals and improving the quality of life for all Tanzanians. Most recently the economy has been significantly challenged by the ongoing pandemic, especially in sectors reliant on global demand. Inflation has been low and stable, but Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2020. Tourism, a major contributor to GDP growth, has declined significantly despite the country reopening for tourism in June and is expected to underperform during the peak season of July–October. Leading indicators of private domestic demand show a deceleration. Domestic credit growth has slowed to 6.9% in January–June 2020 from 8.9% in the first half of 2019. Imports of capital goods, a major component of private investment, declined by about 24% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020. Business expectations for sales and employment for the next six months are pessimistic. Political uncertainty surrounding general elections may also be contributing to a delay in private investment this year.The current economic outlook is highly uncertain, and risks are tilted to the downside. A protracted global health crisis that continues in 2021 could undermine global demand and thus the Tanzanian economy. Even if the global health crisis is contained, additional trade and logistics restrictions could continue disrupting global trade during the recovery. A full recovery in 2021–2022 requires government attention to reforms to improve the business environment as a key input to bolster recovery of the private sector. Tanzania trails its regional peers in terms of actual reforms. According the World Bank Doing Business Report 2020, Tanzania ranks 141 out of 190 economies in ease to doing business, trailing Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda and Sub-Saharan peers like Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique. Reforms for a more favorable and predictable business environment are needed, particularly in terms of business regulation as per the government’s \"Blueprint for regulatory reforms to improve the business environment.\"Social ContextThe December 2019 Tanzania Mainland Poverty Assessment notes that despite sustained economic growth and a persistent decline in poverty, the absolute number of poor people grew from 13 million in 2007, to 14 million today. Vulnerability is also still high: for every four Tanzanians who moved out of poverty, three fell into it. A large number of non-poor people living just above the poverty line are at risk of slipping below it. Beyond the persistent gaps between urban and rural areas, there are large disparities in the distribution of poverty across geographic regions. Poverty is highly concentrated in the western and lake zones, and lowest in the eastern zones.

The country’s broad vision of its development goals as a middle-income country in 2025 are set out in the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, characterized by high-quality livelihoods; peace, stability, and unity; good governance; a well-educated and learning society; and a competitive economy capable of sustainable growth and shared benefits. Increased GNI per capita is impressive but not enough to reach these goals. Investing in both human development and physical capital is key to achieving these broad goals and improving the quality of life for all Tanzanians. Most recently the economy has been significantly challenged by the ongoing pandemic, especially in sectors reliant on global demand. Inflation has been low and stable, but Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2020. Tourism, a major contributor to GDP growth, has declined significantly despite the country reopening for tourism in June and is expected to underperform during the peak season of July–October. Leading indicators of private domestic demand show a deceleration. Domestic credit growth has slowed to 6.9% in January–June 2020 from 8.9% in the first half of 2019. Imports of capital goods, a major component of private investment, declined by about 24% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020. Business expectations for sales and employment for the next six months are pessimistic. Political uncertainty surrounding general elections may also be contributing to a delay in private investment this year.The current economic outlook is highly uncertain, and risks are tilted to the downside. A protracted global health crisis that continues in 2021 could undermine global demand and thus the Tanzanian economy. Even if the global health crisis is contained, additional trade and logistics restrictions could continue disrupting global trade during the recovery. A full recovery in 2021–2022 requires government attention to reforms to improve the business environment as a key input to bolster recovery of the private sector. Tanzania trails its regional peers in terms of actual reforms. According the World Bank Doing Business Report 2020, Tanzania ranks 141 out of 190 economies in ease to doing business, trailing Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda and Sub-Saharan peers like Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique. Reforms for a more favorable and predictable business environment are needed, particularly in terms of business regulation as per the government’s \"Blueprint for regulatory reforms to improve the business environment.\"Social ContextThe December 2019 Tanzania Mainland Poverty Assessment notes that despite sustained economic growth and a persistent decline in poverty, the absolute number of poor people grew from 13 million in 2007, to 14 million today. Vulnerability is also still high: for every four Tanzanians who moved out of poverty, three fell into it. A large number of non-poor people living just above the poverty line are at risk of slipping below it. Beyond the persistent gaps between urban and rural areas, there are large disparities in the distribution of poverty across geographic regions. Poverty is highly concentrated in the western and lake zones, and lowest in the eastern zones.

        CONTEXTTanzania’s solid macroeconomic performance during the past six years is being put to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the poverty rate in the country has declined, the absolute number of poor citizens has not because of the high population growth rate. The country's overall population is about 58 million (2019).  Political ContextIn October 2015, H.E John Pombe Magufuli was elected the fifth president of the United Republic of Tanzania. Magufuli’s Fifth-Phase Government has prioritized efforts to clampdown on corruption, improve public administration and manage public resources for improved social outcomes. The 2020 Worldwide Governance Indicators show Tanzania has either deteriorated or has been stagnant in all governance indicators between 2012 and 2019 (except for control of corruption). The strongest decline has been in voice and accountability, in political stability/violence and rule of law.

        World Bank Group (WBG) Engagement in TanzaniaThe World Bank’s active portfolio in Tanzania includes 20 national International Development Association (IDA) projects with total net commitments of $4.57 billion. Key sectors supported include transport (23%), urban development (18%), education (17%), energy (14%), water (11%), social protection (8%), health/nutrition (4%), environment/natural resources (3%) and agriculture, governance and poverty projects make up 2% of the portfolio. Tanzania is also included in seven regional projects, with its total commitments reaching $940 million supporting the transport, energy, environment, health and education sectors.In March 2018, the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors endorsed the new Tanzania Country Partnership Framework 2018-2022 (CPF). The CPF is informed by extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders as well as a country opinion survey. Aligned with the priorities identified in Tanzania’s Second Five-Year Development Plan and Zanzibar’s Third Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty, the CPF has three focus areas: (1) enhance productivity and accelerate equitable and sustainable growth, (2) boost human capital and social inclusion, and (3) modernize and improve the efficiency of public institutions. A Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the Tanzania CPF is planned for FY21.The CPF 2018-2022 represents both continuity with, and enhancement of, the current program and more intensive engagement in priority areas. It will deepen investments in transport, information and communication technology, and energy to support spatial transformation and inclusive growth, and will significantly scale up human capital development. These interventions will address the rural-urban divide and boost the enablers for poverty reduction that affect access to infrastructure, social services and productive jobs. Given the key role of the private sector, the new framework will innovate to maximize access to finance and generate jobs for Tanzania’s development.International Finance Corporation (IFC)IFC’s strategy in Tanzania involves proactively developing pipeline projects through investment and advisory interventions, focusing on finance, energy and service. IFC will also works closely with IDA to identify actions to promote more rapid commercialization of agriculture.The IFC places emphasis on strengthening financial markets, particularly in terms of access to finance for micro and small-medium enterprises. IFC is looking to forge partnerships with local banks aimed at supporting its initiatives in the financial sector with local currency financing, as well as developing products to support the microfinance, small-medium enterprises and housing sectors. IFC seeks to provide advisory services to improve the investment climate through reform programs that cover licensing, regulatory reform and other areas tracked in the Doing Business indicators.Knowledge ProductsHigh-quality, consolidated knowledge products facilitated and deepened policy dialogue, and informed design and realization of government programs. These products were used to inform plans for, e.g., tourism-led growth and initiatives related to energy, governance, education, and natural resources.The Tanzania Economic Update series has focused on a range of topics: productive jobs, unlocking the potential of the tourism industry, improving tax performance, leveraging public private partnerships to finance development; the importance of investing in girls and human capital development.Under the current CPF, the Bank will continue to use analytics to guide operations, prepared in close collaboration with the client and taking into consideration counterpart capacity. Knowledge products will use a combination of hands-on technical assistance, impact evaluations, policy notes and broader reports to inform the lending programs and policy dialogue. The Tanzania Systematic Country Diagnostic, completed in March 2017, has been recognized by a broad range of stakeholders as an important source of knowledge.

        Human Capital: According to the World Bank’s Human Capital Index 2020 (HCI 2020), a child born in Tanzania today will be 39% as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. This is slightly lower than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa region and lower than the average for lower middle-income countries.Health: Tanzania has had a substantial decline in infant and under-five mortality rates, from 136 in 1999 to 50 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2019. In 2020, 95 out of 100 children born today survive to age 5, but 32 out of 100 children are stunted, and so are at risk of cognitive and physical limitations that can last a lifetime (HCI 2020).Education: Levels of education access, completion and equity have improved, as did levels of secondary educational attainment for both women and men. As a result of the Fee-Free Basic Education Policy, enrollment rose by 17% in primary, from 8.6 million to 10.1 million, and by 23% in secondary, from 1.8 million to 2.2 million, over four years (2015-2018).Between 2016-2018, there has been a substantial increase in student retention with a 39% increase in student survival through primary schools and 4% increase in the number of students transitioning to lower secondary. The gender gap has narrowed in primary and lower secondary education but remains in upper secondary whereby girls make up 38% of upper secondary enrollment.Financial SectorIn December 2018, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to review the financial sector landscape in Tanzania, including financial sector stability and development aspect (diversification and financial inclusion). The FSAP results aim to support the government and regulators to strengthen and develop a well-diversified financial sector.The Bank has also been actively supporting development of the long-term finance market, especially the capital market and housing finance. The Bank supported the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) to move from a manual trading system to an automated trading system and provide options/recommendations for new product development. This also led to the establishment of the Tanzania Mercantile Exchange.On housing finance, the Bank has supported the development of the mortgage finance and affordable housing markets through a sustainable private sector-driven approach. The Tanzania Mortgage Refinance Company (TMRC) was established to provide medium and long-term liquidity to financial institutions. Between 2011 and 2017, the mortgage portfolio significantly increased and financial institutions offering mortgage products increased 11 times while maturity of mortgage loans is now three-to-five times longer. TMRC has also started to raise capital from the bond market and the project is now a strong model of maximizing finance for development. In addition, there has been progress in the areas of housing conditions, ownership of assets, and access to clean drinking water and sanitation, including for the poor and rural populations.

        Donor coordination has been strong at the sector level, and sector working groups have been effective. The World Bank has been actively engaged in and has often led coordination in, for example, fiscal management and public expenditure review, governance, statistics and poverty monitoring, energy, transport, agriculture, private sector development, health and education, and ICT. Leveraging its unique global expertise and knowledge in individual sectors, the Bank has been playing a catalytic role in informing the sector-level dialogues and supports by the donors in the country.Partnering with other development organizations for lending and analytical work has been at the core of the World Bank Group’s country partnership framework in Tanzania. Several large lending programs, such as the Productive Social Safety Net Project, the Education Program-for-Results, the Health Program-for-Results, and the Dar es Salaam Maritime Gateway Project, are co-financed by bilateral donors, including the US, UK, and Sweden. Partnerships through trust funds, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), transport and urban resilience (the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), investment climate advisory services (Global Affairs Canada), statistical capacity building (European Union), and state-owned enterprise reforms (Norway), provide important complementary support to generation of knowledge on important development issues in Tanzania while facilitating government’s capacity building in related areas.

        Located on Africa’s west coast, Togo is bordered by Ghana, Benin, and Burkina Faso and is home to approximately 7.8 million people. Although the poverty rate fell from 61.7% in 2006 to 53.5% in 2017, poverty and inequality remain extremely high, particularly in rural areas where 69% of households were living below the poverty line in 2015.This is largely attributable to a high annual population growth rate of 2.5% that is outpacing development progress, concentrated economic growth in the modern sectors, and limited access to quality services.  Poverty is also higher in female-headed households (57.5%),  and vulnerability is higher among women because they have fewer economic opportunities.Togo’s score on the human capital index (HCI) remains low at 0.41. This means that children born in Togo today will be only 41% as productive when they grow up as they could be if they had access to good health, education, and nutrition.Political ContextThe ruling Union pour la République (UNIR) party has dominated the political scene for several years, and won 59 of the 91 seats in the National Assembly in the 2018 legislative elections. Presidential elections held on February 22, 2020 returned the incumbent, Faure Gnassingbé, to power.  At the helm since 2005, Gnassingbé is now serving his fourth five-year term.On September 28, 2020, Victoire Tomégah-Dogbé was appointed Prime Minister, becoming the first woman to hold this position in Togo's political history.For the first time in 32 years, Togo held local elections in June 2019 to elect municipal councilors.

The services sector nevertheless remains the main engine of growth thanks to expanding port and airport operations. However, the crisis triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to a decline in growth to 1% in 2020.Inflation returned to negative territory in December 2019, driven by an ample food supply owing to increased agricultural productivity and lower communication costs. Average annual inflation dipped slightly from 0.9% in 2018 to 0.7% in 2019.A rebound in capital goods imports and a reduction in exports increased the current transactions deficit from 3.5% of GDP in 2018 to 4% in 2019. Foreign direct investments and concessional loans helped finance the current account deficit.  Reforms to improve public financial management with IMF and World Bank support reduced debt, which fell from 76.2% of GDP in 2018 to 70.9% of GDP in 2019.  The fiscal deficit stabilized at 1.2% of GDP in 2019, which is below the threshold set in the convergence criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).Growth prospects will be severely undermined by the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 crisis. The slowdown in global economic growth, coupled with the prevention measures for containing the virus contagion, could reduce production, domestic consumption, and exports.

        The government’s current development policy has been included in its National Development Plan (PND) for the period 2018-2022. The overarching goal is to structurally transform the economy in order to foster strong growth, social inclusion, job creation and to modernize institutions through investments in the digital technology.World Bank Group engagement  in Togo is aligned with this PND and guided by a Country Partnership Framework  for the 2017-2022 period. This framework is financing projects in key areas:private sector development and job creation;improvements in the governance of all sectors and in human capital;   provision of essential public services, in particular access to water and health;environmental sustainability and resilience.As of March 31, 2020, the World Bank’s portfolio in Togo had 10 national projects and 6 regional programs, for a total commitment of over $490 million provided mainly by the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Group institution that helps the world’s poorest countries.COVID-19 Response: On April 29, 2020, the World Bank also disbursed $8.1 million in emergency financing to help Togo combat the coronavirus pandemic and implement its response strategy which is articulated around three goals:Saving lives by strengthening the health sector and providing the necessary equipment to health care facilities.Restoring people’s lives and livelihoods though cash transfers and social safety nets to protect the poor households.Rebuilding the economy by helping firms and financial institutions regain a solid footing and by supporting the agriculture sector.The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group institution focused on private sector development, is prioritizing access to financing for small and medium Togolese enterprises through local banks. IFC strategy in Togo also centers on projects in agribusiness, infrastructure, and manufacturing.IFC also provides advisory services in the financial, energy, and manufacturing sectors, and is helping the government implement reforms aimed at improving the investment climate in the country. This support has helped improve Togo’s ranking in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business report from 137th in 2019 to 97th in 2020, making Togo the leading reformer in Africa and third best in the world.IFC’s portfolio in Togo stands at approximately $330 million, allocated primarily to the financial, energy, and transport sectors.

        Examples of the progress made by Togo with financing or technical assistance from the World Bank Group are as follows:Business environmentLower electricity connection costs have made it easier to do business;Land tenure reform has resulted in streamlined procedures and a sharp reduction in property transfer costs;Access to information on credit, expansion of coverage from the Office de crédit, and the introduction of reporting of data from utility companies have also helped foster entrepreneurship.Agriculture and agricultural productivityClosed in December 2019, the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program  (WAAPP) has:strengthened the capacities of the Togolese Agricultural Research Institute (ITRA) and the Advisory and Technical Support Institute (ICAT);supported the expansion of regional trade in agricultural technologies and innovation, as well as the improvement of national seed production and distribution systems;significantly increased the production of certified seeds from 1,260 metric tons to almost 2,600 metric tons, of which 1,674 metric tons were for maize and 751 metric tons for rice. Average gross income per hectare rose from CFAF 136,059 per producer to CFAF 286,969 for maize producers and from CFAF 137,910 to CFAF 231,632 for rice producers;disseminated 30 different technologies through agricultural extension and advisory services, NGOs, and producer organizations;provided scholarships to 77 managers, 12 of whom were women, to pursue master’s or doctoral degrees, with a view to strengthening the country’s capacity in agricultural research and related disciplines.  The Agriculture Sector Support Project (PASA)  has supported:more than 150,000 farmers, 80,000 livestock producers, 4,700 fishers, 33.43% of whom are women, to help them develop strategic subsistence crops such as maize, rice, cassava, pineapple, honey, soy, and peanuts, and export crops such as coffee, cocoa, and cotton. the processing of agricultural products by helping establish 20 service companies and producer organizations and create over 56,500 jobs.To date, PASA has used its partial financing mechanism for subprojects to finance 190 agricultural microenterprises and support 206 fish farms.Livestock production and food securityAlthough home to 13% of the global population, Africa provides just 4% of the world’s poultry products. Established in 2014 under the World Bank-financed African Centers of Excellence Project, the Regional Center of Excellence on Avian Sciences (CERSA) is seeking to revolutionize the poultry sector in West and Central Africa:CERSA attracts students of different nationalities and offers doctoral and master’s degree programs, as well as short-term professional courses for poultry technicians;Its 58 Ph.D and 173 master’s students from 12 African countries are conducting research to support the local and regional poultry industry;Since its establishment, the institute has provided technical training to over 900 poultry farmers in Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal;Several partnerships with other universities in Africa, Europe, and China have enabled CERSA to promote research and knowledge sharing among practitioners;It has also forged strategic partnerships with key players from the private sector and major manufacturers to promote the industrialization of the sector in Africa.CERSA’s success has paved the way for Togo to establish two new centers of excellence for sustainable cities and energy.

However, the crisis triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to a decline in growth to 1% in 2020.Inflation returned to negative territory in December 2019, driven by an ample food supply owing to increased agricultural productivity and lower communication costs. Average annual inflation dipped slightly from 0.9% in 2018 to 0.7% in 2019.A rebound in capital goods imports and a reduction in exports increased the current transactions deficit from 3.5% of GDP in 2018 to 4% in 2019. Foreign direct investments and concessional loans helped finance the current account deficit.  Reforms to improve public financial management with IMF and World Bank support reduced debt, which fell from 76.2% of GDP in 2018 to 70.9% of GDP in 2019.  The fiscal deficit stabilized at 1.2% of GDP in 2019, which is below the threshold set in the convergence criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).Growth prospects will be severely undermined by the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 crisis. The slowdown in global economic growth, coupled with the prevention measures for containing the virus contagion, could reduce production, domestic consumption, and exports. Revenues could plummet, whereas additional expenditures are essential to a robust health and economic response and the protection of businesses and households hardest hit by the crisis.

        External financial assistance has continued to increase since international donors reengaged with Togo in 2007 and the World Bank Group is working closely with Togo’s other development partners. The European Union has ramped up its financial and technical support, and the African Development Bank has prepared and implemented a new Country Strategy for 2016–2020. Bilateral partners (China, France, Germany, and the United States) are also increasing their support for Togo’s development.To channel this financial aid more effectively, a government initiative has established aid coordination committees by sector.

        StrategyNumber of Active Projects20Net IBRD Commitments$6.408 MillionTrust Fund Portfolio$224.15 MillionThe partnership between Turkey and the World Bank Group (WBG) is outlined in the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), which was initially designed to cover the FY18–21 period but has recently been updated and extended to include FY22–23 through the Performance and Learning Review (PLR), that was discussed at the WBG’s Board of Directors on March 13, 2020.The PLR confirmed that the CPF’s pillars of growth, inclusion, and sustainability remain valid and that most of the objectives set out under these pillars also remain relevant, although some amendments were incorporated into the program to reflect the changes in country circumstances, client demand, and the program’s evolution.  Continued support from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) was confirmed due to Turkey’s challenging economic context, which is leading to in decreasing rather than increasing income per capita in dollar terms.The WBG program ensures continued alignment with the Government’s strategies, including the recently launched 11th National Development Plan (NDP, 2019–23) and the New Economic Program (2018–21) of Turkey. The Bank program continues to maintain a long-term focus that maximizes opportunities to support Turkey’s progression to higher-income status.With the onset of the COVID-19 global crisis, the WBG program in Turkey for FY20–,21 has been adjusted to support the Government’s response. In line with the framework of the WBG Approach Paper “Saving Lives, Scaling-up Impact and Getting Back on Track” the Bank’s COVID-19 response spans the relief, restructuring, and resilient recovery continuum. The lending and analytical programs initially envisaged in the PLR have been complemented with new lending and Advisory Services and Analytics (ASAs) targeted to supporting the response to the pandemic.The WBG will continue to deliver a mix of instruments from across its institutions, drawing on the strengths of the IBRD, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).The implementation of the CPF to date has resulted in IBRD lending delivery totaling US$3.9 billion, including investment operations in energy, access to finance, municipal development, disaster risk resilience, and the water sector. The average annual IBRD lending delivery at $1.3 billion has been aligned with that envisaged in the CPF’s annual lending targets of between $1 and $1.5 billion.IFC’s portfolio implementation continued to perform satisfactorily, and its committed portfolio as of September 2020 amounted to $4,281 million, the second largest worldwide and the largest in the Europe and Central Asia region. Since May 2020, Turkey has received several investments under the IFC COVID-19 crisis response facilities. IFC invested $989 million in Turkey in long-term finance (LTF), of which $523 million was  of its own account and $466 million was mobilized from other investors.  This is higher than the indicative targets for IFC in the CPF.MIGA’s guarantee gross exposure in Turkey has grown substantially in the past decade from $458 million in FY13 to $1.695 billion in FY16. It currently stands at $2.77 billion (FY20), making Turkey the largest exposure country in MIGA’s portfolio, with 12 percent of total gross exposure. MIGA’s intervention has mobilized foreign private financing in support of strategic areas, such as the health public-private partnerships, financial sector and export markets, and infrastructure sectors, via municipal financing. The product mix includes traditional political risk insurance as well as the non-honoring of credit guarantees. Going forward, MIGA will continue to remain selective to optimize development opportunities for private sector mobilization, while ensuring close coordination with the Bank and IFC within the context of the WBG CPF.Key EngagementSupporting the Government’s response to COVID-19 has taken center stage in the WBG program along the four lines of the WBG’s global approach:To save lives: In the fourth quarter of FY20, the Bank added a $100 million to the CPF/PLR program for the Turkey Emergency COVID-19 Health Project (P173988) from the Fast-Track Facility as the key component of the relief phase of the COVID response. In parallel, it restructured US$134 million in ongoing Health System Strengthening and Support (P152799) to provide additional support for urgent health needs.To protect the poor and vulnerable: Also in the fourth quarter, the Bank added a US$160 million Safer Schooling and Distance Education Project (P173997), which supports equitable access to distance learning and protects human capital. The Digital Education platform that will be strengthened and scaled up under the project will contribute to a restructured and more resilient digital education system for post-COVID-19 blended (face-to-face and online) teaching and learning.  To save livelihoods, preserve jobs, and ensure more sustainable business growth and job creation: As part of the resilient recovery phase, the Bank is adding two new operations to the program in FY21. The first is the recently approved Emergency Firm Support Project ($500 million, P174112), and the second is the proposed Rapid Support for Micro and Small Enterprises during COVID-19 Project ($300 million, P174144) implemented by the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) support agency of the Ministry of Industry and Technology and targeted at smaller MSMEs.  These new operations aim to preserve jobs.A further operation, the Long-Term Export Finance Guarantee Project ($300 million, P156252, approved in the fourth quarter of FY20), which was envisaged in the CPF/PLR and was under preparation before COVID, has been adapted to enhance the ability of Turkey’s Eximbank to raise funds on capital markets to support viable exporting firms affected by the COVID-induced trade slowdown. Finally, the implementation of the ongoing Inclusive Access to Finance has been accelerated to leverage its focus on women-inclusive firms and firms operating in lagging regions in the COVID-19 context.To strengthen policies, institutions, and investments for resilient, inclusive, and sustainable growth: The portfolio of core and extended core ASAs envisaged in the PLR will focus on strengthening policies, institutions. and investments for resilient and sustainable recovery.  Special attention is being paid to timely preparation of the Pandemic Preparedness ASA. Moreover, when preparing the operations that had been envisaged in the PLR’s pre-COVID pipeline for FY21, a strong emphasis will be put on strengthening sectoral policies and institutions to support a “building back better” approach. These operations include the Geothermal Development Project Additional Finance (P172827), Resilient Landscape Integration Project (P172562), Organized Industrial Zones Project (P171645), Urban Resilience Project (P173025), and Scaling-Up Rooftop Solar PV Project (P172854).Another key engagement involves supporting the Government’s response to the 3.6 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey. The WBG is partnering with the EU’s Facility for Refugees in Turkey (FRiT) and is implementing programs in the areas of social support and adaptation, labor markets and the economy, municipal services and education, as well as in the cross- cutting areas of data collection, measurement, and monitoring.In addition to the FRiT funds, the portfolio is also supported by a broad set of Trust Funds, most notably, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), EU Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) funds, Global Environmental Facility (GEF) funds, and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) Gender Funds.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsGDP contracted 10 percent in the second quarter year-on-year (y-o-y) as Turkey faced the full effect of COVID-19. Beginning in mid-March, cases rapidly reached 5,000 a day before the prompt introduction of targeted measures brought new cases down to under 1,000 a day by June. But with a return to business-as-usual, cases are rising again.From a surplus last year, the current account tumbled back into a deficit as exports were decimated. The deficit was US$20 billion (3.4 percent of GDP) in the first half of 2020 as exports fell 21 percent y-o-y while imports declined just 4 percent.In response to the COVID-19 shock, the authorities resorted to aggressive monetary loosening. Policy interest rates, falling since mid-2019, turned negative in real terms. The Central Bank used several liquidity measures to boost the money supply. A targeted fiscal expansion supported furloughed workers, firms, households, and health services, with the 12-month central government deficit reaching 3.4 percent of GDP in June.Credit, which grew by 29 percent y-o-y by August, was further supported by the loosening of macro-prudential regulations and extending government credit guarantees. The Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency (BRSA) introduced forbearance measures that relaxed the definitions of nonperforming loans and Stage-2 loans, making it challenging to assess banks’ true asset quality.Global uncertainty and domestic monetary loosening led to steady capital outflows, amounting to more than US$20 billion (net) between March and June. These were offset by an additional US$10 billion swap line with the Qatar Central Bank and the use of Central Bank reserves. Even so, the Turkish lira depreciated by 29 percent against the U.S. dollar between January and the end of August. The loose monetary stance and depreciation contributed to the persistence of high inflation, which reached 11.8 percent y-o-y in August.Economic Outlook Although the economy seems to be rebounding from its low point this year, new outbreaks of COVID-19 could easily reverse progress. Over the rest of this year, the economy is expected to slowly rebound, but GDP is still projected to decline by 3.8 percent in 2020, led by the massive deterioration in the current account, lower consumption on the demand side, and declines in both services and manufacturing output. Economic growth could recover to 4 percent in 2021 and 4.5 percent in 2022. A downside scenario could see growth of just 1 percent next year.Monetary policy needs to sharpen its focus on price and financial stability, with a return of real policy rates to positive territory. A 200-basis point rate rise in September marks a move in that direction, while the New Economic Plan focuses on stability and maps out both central and downside scenarios for the coming years.Inflation is expected to average nearly 12 percent over 2020 and remain around 10 percent in 2021 and 2022. The current account is expected to remain in deficit over these years, as exports struggle to fully recover while global markets continue to suffer from weaker demand. The general government deficit for 2020 is projected to increase to 5.4 percent of GDP.Turkey’s external risk profile is heightened as gross international reserves have fallen and can now scarcely cover one year’s national debt service, with much of the reserves borrowed from the banking sector.Poverty is nevertheless expected to increase only  moderately, driven by the negative labor income impacts of COVID-19. Households that lost jobs or stopped actively seeking work will be the worst affected. The poverty rate is projected to rise to 9.0 percent by end-2020, despite various income support measures, and hover around 8.5 percent in 2021 and 2022.

        Country ContextTurkmenistan2018Population, million5.8GDP, current US$ billion40.8GDP per capita, current US$7,065Life Expectancy at birth, years67.8Turkmenistan is located at the center of the Eurasian continent and has been classified as an upper-middle-income country since 2012. It borders Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and, to the west of the country, the Caspian Sea, which offers abundant natural resources of gas and oil deposits.Turkmenistan’s gas reserves are estimated to be the world’s fourth largest, representing about 10 percent of global reserves. In addition to cotton and natural gas, the country is rich in petroleum, sulfur, iodine, salt, bentonite clays, limestone, gypsum, and cement—all potential inputs to chemical and construction industries.Although in July 2019 Turkmenistan signed a five-year contract with the Russian Federation to supply natural gas, the resumed volumes will be significantly lower than three years ago, making China the largest market for Turkmenistan’s hydrocarbon exports. Additionally, the country is in the process of constructing the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline. Gas exports to other regions through gas swap mechanisms would help diminish the risk of overreliance on a single client.Tight administrative controls and the public sector’s dominant role in economic activity have hindered private sector development. Despite the growth of the private sector’s share in segments of the economy, public sector and state-owned monopolies continue to govern the economy and the formal labor market.

        StrategyThe World Bank and TurkmenistanThe latest strategy for Turkmenistan, the Country Engagement Note (CEN) FY16–17, focused on deepening collaboration in such areas as financial sector development and improved macroeconomic statistics. In non-lending operations, the World Bank Group (WBG) has been sharing the relevant international knowledge, experience, and best practices in areas critical to Turkmenistan’s growth agenda and its attempted integration into the global economy.Funded by the Government of Turkmenistan and supplemented by the Bank’s other Advisory Services and Analytics, the knowledge-based Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) program—the cornerstone of the CEN—was prepared to support and be consistent with the Government’s strategic priorities.The Government and the WBG are currently in the process of identifying potential areas for expanding cooperation to help Turkmenistan implement additional reforms and overcome obstacles impeding the country’s socioeconomic development potential.Key EngagementDuring 2016–18, the WBG and the Government of Turkmenistan implemented the second RAS agreement, which was an integral part of the CEN for Turkmenistan.The RAS program was designed to support business model reform and corporate governance in the banking sector, the development of a credit reporting system, the administration of national risk assessments with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing, and the strengthening of macroeconomic statistics. The entire program under the agreement was managed, delivered, and supervised by the WBG in line with international best practices.Currently, the WBG and the Turkmen authorities are discussing potential areas to be included in a new RAS agreement to continue supporting Turkmenistan’s development objectives, as stated in the National Program for Social and Econmic Development, through the transfer of global knowledge and expertise and capacity-building activities.Recent and ongoing World Bank support is focused on such areas as the development of a welfare-monitoring system, support for a regional water and climate agenda, and technical assistance for the hydrometeorology committee.

        Economic DevelopmentsThe following analysis is based on estimations using the limited data available and should therefore be viewed in this context.Real GDP growth weakened slightly in 2018, slowing to 6.2 percent from 6.5 percent in 2017, reflecting a decline in the non-hydrocarbon economy. Net exports positively contributed to economic growth, but this was more than offset by weakened domestic demand that reflected a decline in public investment to 22 percent of GDP in 2018 from an average of 30 percent in 2014–17. Following the Government’s decision to discontinue the free provision of water, natural gas, electricity, and salt, the authorities eliminated budget subsidies for utilities, which also negatively impacted domestic demand.The Government’s fiscal consolidation efforts nearly resulted in a balanced budget in 2018 compared to a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2017. Revenue was bolstered by higher hydrocarbon proceeds, while public spending was reduced by 17.6 percent on account of sharp cuts to public investment and subsidies.Turkmenistan’s external position reversed in 2018: the current account recorded a surplus of 5.7 percent of GDP from a deficit of 10.3 percent of GDP in 2017. Higher prices and export volumes of natural gas were the main drivers of this reversal. Meanwhile, continued import substitution efforts, combined with lower demand for imported construction materials, resulted in a 47.8 percent reduction in imports.The authorities continued their directed lending and easy credit policies in 2018, although credit growth slowed slightly. The loan portfolio continues to be allocated mostly to SOEs at concessional financing terms by the central bank. Turkmenistan does not release official statistics on living standards, and little is known about the country’s labor market. Data constraints prevent a thorough analysis of the social impact of slower economic growth.Economic OutlookTurkmenistan’s weak economic outlook reflects a projected fall in the price of natural gas and the softening global demand for energy resources. The global economy, including China and Russia, is expected to slow down in 2019–20. As noted above, Turkmenistan’s new five-year contract to supply natural gas to Russia  will involve volumes that are significantly lower than when trade was suspended three year ago.Policies aimed at fostering private sector development and economic diversification should be prioritized to promote the non-hydrocarbon sectors and contribute to inclusive growth.Inflationary and exchange rate pressures are expected to remain as hydrocarbon earnings decline. The authorities are likely to adhere to the exchange rate peg; considerations to adjust the national currency will largely depend on the evolution of the public sector’s foreign liabilities.Turkmenistan’s external position is projected to deteriorate in 2019–20 but then benefit from the expected expansion of natural gas exports. The country’s industrial output is also expected to respond to the Government’s export-promotion and import-substitution policies. However, ongoing challenges associated with expatriating profits will discourage strong FDI inflows.The Government will seek fiscal consolidation in the medium term to rebuild depleted policy buffers. However, the expansion of public investment in strategic infrastructure using off-budgetary funds cannot be ruled out.Although ending free access to water, gas, and electricity may result in a deterioration in living standards for the poor, such measures underscore the Government’s commitment to improving the finances of Turkmenistan’s utilities and reducing state budget liabilities. The agriculture sector—which employs most of the labor force—is expected to benefit from increased government procurement prices for wheat and cotton, which were raised by 100 percent and 50 percent, respectively, in January 2019.

        StrategyWorld Bank PortfolioNumber of active projects23Lending$4.44 BillionIBRD$2.15 BillionIDA$2.29 BillionThe World Bank is progressing with the preparation of the Systematic Country Diagnostic for Uzbekistan to inform the development of a new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY22–26. The CPF will outline the assistance that the Bank will provide in the next five years to help the Government implement important social, economic, and institutional reforms.The Bank’s country program under the ongoing CPF was adjusted in 2018 to support the Government’s reform agenda that was launched in 2017. It is currently focusing on the following areas prioritized by the authorities: i) a sustainable transformation to a market economy; ii) reform of state institutions and citizen engagement; and iii) investments in human capital, including health and education sector development. In 2020, it was adapted to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic.Key EngagementThe World Bank Group’s financial and technical assistance and analytical support have grown substantially since 2017, bolstering the Government’s efforts to implement a comprehensive program of reforms for Uzbekistan’s transition to a market economy.Today, the Bank’s country program in Uzbekistan is the second largest in the Europe and Central Asia region after Turkey.As of October 1, 2020, the program consisted of 23 projects, with net commitments totaling US$4.44 billion. They include loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) for US$2.15 billion and credits from the International Development Association (IDA) for US$2.29 billion.It supports the Government in implementing economic and institutional reforms; modernizing the agriculture, health, education, water supply and sanitation, energy, transport, and social protection sectors; and promoting urban and rural development.Responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the Government, the World Bank, in close coordination with other development partners, has provided emergency financing totaling US$295 million to help Uzbekistan cope with the immediate health, social, economic, and budgetary implications of the crisis.The Bank’s project portfolio in Uzbekistan is complemented by a comprehensive program of technical assistance and advisory and analytical services delivered jointly with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The current program includes core diagnostics work, such as a Systematic Country Diagnostic, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Poverty Reduction Assessment; inputs to the Government’s strategies in agriculture, transport, and energy; and technical assistance activities supporting reforms in the aviation, tax policy and administration, and banking sectors, trade facilitation, poverty reduction, and citizen engagement in Uzbekistan.IFC is also expanding its country program. As of October 1, 2020, it had US$105 million in investment commitments in Uzbekistan that provide services assisting the Government in privatizing state-owned banks, transforming the cotton sector, modernizing the chemical industry, developing and diversifying the financial market, and piloting public-private partnerships in the energy and health sectors.

        EconomyRecent Economic DevelopmentsIn the first half of 2020, GDP growth was nearly zero compared to growth of 5.8 percent in the first half of 2019. Investment in fixed capital decreased by 12.8 percent in the same period. The unemployment rate increased sharply from 9.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 to 15 percent in the second quarter.Higher gold production and agriculture growth helped offset a sharp fall in industry and services. A cumulative increase of 17 percent in social payments and a 10 percent increase in minimum wages since February have helped preserve private consumption despite a 19 percent decline in remittances.Lower remittances and a wider trade deficit widened the current account deficit to 7.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2020. Exports fell by 22.6 percent in the same period, due to supply chain disruptions and a fall in key commodity prices (natural gas, metals). Imports fell by 15 percent due to a sharp fall in machinery and capital imports.The fiscal deficit increased to 5 percent of GDP. About 2.5 percent of GDP was directed to support health, low-income allowances, public works, and enterprises.Annual inflation was eased down to 11.6 percent in August, which allowed the Central Bank to cut its policy rate twice in 2020, from 16 to 15 percent in April and to 14 percent in September. Anti-crisis credit lines to firms helped increase credit to the economy by 18 percent in January–August 2020.Economic OutlookThe lifting of lockdowns in the third quarter of the year, robust agricultural production, and a partial recovery of remittances will result in stronger economic activity in the second half of 2020 than in the first half.Annual GDP growth is projected to be between 0.4 and 0.8 percent in 2020. Assuming limited further lockdowns, GDP growth is projected to be between 4.8 and 5.0 percent in 2021.Inflation will moderate over the medium term but remain elevated by further price reforms. The current account deficit is expected to be around 6 percent of GDP in 2020, and the deficit is expected to be financed by higher public borrowing and, gradually, by rising foreign investment.The projected fiscal deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP in 2020 will moderate in 2021–22 and is expected to be financed by increased external borrowing.Public external debt will increase to about 35 percent of GDP in 2020. Although debt has increased since 2017, it is expected to stabilize over the medium term, with most of the increase linked to a scale-up in multilateral support for the reform program.

        ALL PROJECTSHighlighted ProjectDeveloping Uzbekistan’s Livestock SectorUzbekistan is a net importer of meat and milk. Keen to improve the country’s nutrition standards, the Government is taking measures to increase the population’s access to livestock products.The country’s livestock sector, employing roughly 3.6 million agricultural workers, is currently characterized by low productivity. Its modernization will not only increase productivity but will also create a significant number of better paid jobs in rural areas, improve food and nutrition security, and increase access to internal and external markets.The Livestock Sector Development Project (LSDP), financed by the World Bank (US$150 million), is designed to achieve these goals by supporting the development of a vibrant, private sector–led livestock sector.The project helps build the capacity of public institutions, including the State Committee for Veterinary and Livestock Development and four agricultural research institutes. It also provides loans through participating Uzbek banks to farmers and agribusinesses that invest in subprojects that enhance the competitiveness of livestock value chains across the country.To date, the LSDP has financed over 500 loans that have boosted investments in the development of the dairy, poultry, beef, fishery, and apiculture industries. Thanks to this funding, the beneficiaries were able to purchase over 28,800 heads of cattle, 16,500 small ruminants, 405 camels, 305 horses, and over 110 units of farm machinery and equipment.These investments have allowed beneficiaries to expand businesses, create jobs, and improve the productivity and quality of their products. For example, the dairy subsector has increased milk production from an average of 8 liters/day/cow to 20 liters/day/cow. Moreover, farmers and agribusinesses benefiting from the project have been able to create over 5,000 new jobs in rural areas. Project investments have also helped beneficiaries to increase the supply of dairy products, meat, poultry, eggs, fish, and honey in local markets to meet the demand for these goods across Uzbekistan.

        The Austria desk at the World Bank Berlin office works to promote consensus around the international development agenda and build a platform for collaboration between the World Bank Group and Austria. It does this by promoting better understanding of the World Bank Group’s mission and activities and by building relationships with key stakeholders such as government, legislators, civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and the media.It also supports outreach activities, often in collaboration with Austrian partners, such as organizing and supporting conferences, seminars, and other events on development-related topics. The office serves as an entry point for groups in Austria wishing to contact World Bank staff across the world or access the plethora of information the Bank publishes, and it responds to media queries. It also seeks to increase opportunities for collaboration between Austria and the World Bank Group through co-financing, trust funds, and joint analytical work in sectors and regions of mutual interest.The World Bank Group's presence in Vienna dates back to 2004, when the European Investor Outreach Program, an initiative of the current Vienna based office of the Investment Climate Department, was managed out of the Austrian capital. Other World Bank Group programs have followed suit, including the Centre for Financial Reporting Reform, the Financial Sector Advisory Centre, as well as the Danube Water Program and the Urban Partnership Program.In 2013, the management of the World Bank’s program in Southeast Europe was decentralized to Vienna, allowing it to take full advantage of the proximity to client countries. From the Vienna office, the Country Director for Southeast Europe leads the management of the World Bank's lending program and analytical work in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, to support their economic development and preparation for eventual European Union membership. The expanded Vienna office was made possible with the kind support of the Austrian Government.

        Chile has been one of Latin America’s fastest-growing economies in recent decades thanks to a solid macroeconomic framework, which enabled the country to cushion the effects of a volatile international context and reduce the population living in poverty (on US$ 5.5 per day) from 30 percent in 2000 to 3.7 percent in 2017. However, more than 30% of the population is economically vulnerable and income inequality remains high.In the context of social unrest, GDP growth decreased from 3.9 percent in 2018 to 1.1 percent in 2019. The disruptions in economic activity resulted in an uptick of unemployment, from 7.1 in December 2018 to 7.4 percent in December 2019. Social unrest caused a change in the composition of public spending away from an investment promotion agenda and towards higher social expenditures. It also induced the government to call for a constitutional referendum currently scheduled for October 25, 2020.The current account deficit increased from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2018 to 3.9 percent in 2019 as lower exports more than offset a decline in imports caused by slowing domestic demand. As foreign investment dropped, the external deficit was financed by private and public external debt, which increased from 62 percent of GDP in 2018 to 70 percent in 2019. Over this period, international reserves increased slightly from US$39.8 to US$40.7 billion despite Central Bank interventions to prevent a higher nominal depreciation.The fiscal deficit increased from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2018 to 2.7 percent in 2019 due to additional spending in response to the civil unrest and the economic slowdown, dampened tax revenues and lower copper exports on revenues. The deficit was partially financed with fiscal buffers, but public debt increased from 26 to 28 percent, mainly domestic debt.The social unrest reflected widely spread frustration with high and persistent inequality of opportunities that prevailed despite significant improvements in social outcomes. Between 2006 and 2017, Chile had reduced poverty (measured as income below US$5.5 2011 international dollars per day) from 19.6 to 3.7 percent, and the vulnerable population (income between US$5.5 and US$13 per day) decreased from 43.9 to 30.1 percent. However, inequality of incomes, as measured by the Gini coefficient, remained around 0.44 in 2017, among the highest in the region. The growing middle class perceives high inequality of opportunities due to segmented service provision in education and health care and segregated labor markets. Jobs and higher wage premiums have largely gone to skilled workers, while workers with fixed-term contracts support a greater workload, have less job security, and have not been traditionally entitled to severance pay or unemployment insurance, though some of this has been addressed in economic measure to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations.The balance of risks is tilted to the downside due to uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 and the fluid domestic political context. Chile is exposed to lower than expected copper prices and longer subdued export demand resulting from the pandemic. Additionally, prolonged containment measures will likely impact on economic activity despite fiscal and monetary stimulus. Similarly, political uncertainty around the constitutional reform could weaken private sector confidence, dampening the recovery.In the medium term, Chile needs to reach political consensus on a policy response to social demands, while not eroding Chile’s traditionally sound macroeconomic management. Chile also should promote productivity gains at the bottom of the income distribution, including by fostering innovation, enhancingthe link between education and the labor market, and promoting female labor participation. Reducing inequality of opportunity will be crucial to eliminate the persistent pockets of poverty and ensure social stability.

        World Bank Group support in Chile includes activities of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The 2017 Systemic Country Diagnostics identified priorities to address the constraints that impede the country from achieving solid, equitable and sustainable growth, improving both equity and productivity.Through multisector coordination, the World Bank seeks to provide solutions to the country’s challenges to promote equal opportunity in three main pillars: social protection of the most vulnerable; decentralization and regional development; and climate change adaptation for sustainable development.In December 2017, the World Bank Group reiterated its support for Chile by opening its first office in Santiago. Through this office, it has strengthened dialogue with the government, provided technical assistance and shared successful public policy experiences. This has enabled the Bank to increase and deepen dialogue with over 30 ministries, public service agencies and regional governments to support public policy design and development in priority areas identified by counterparts.Over the past four years, through the World Bank’s reimbursable advisory services (RAS), more than 30 studies were commissioned in the areas of higher education, health, social protection systems, institutional development, water, concessions, innovation, gender, territorial and sub-national development. Financial assistance from RAS centers on a US$ 50 million project to strengthen Chile’s public universities. Additionally, the World Bank is supporting the Pacific Alliance in the development of financial protection instruments in the event of natural disasters, which initially took the form of a catastrophe bond to cover earthquake risks, providing Chile with US$ 500 million in coverage.The World Bank also supports the country’s climate change agenda in areas including forests, sustainable land management and geothermal energy through the channeling of US$ 19.6 million in grant funds. In 2019, Chile signed an agreement with the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, a global partnership administered by the World Bank, for which it will receive up to US$ 26 million to increase carbon capture and reduce emissions in the forest sector. Additionally, the World Bank has supported the country’s climate change agenda in revising its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and the development of a long-term climate strategy, which will be the focus of the Chilean presidency leading the COP25 in 2020. Strategic support areas include the analysis of the Chilean experience for electromobility and the blue economy. In 2019, the World Bank also supported the country in several activities it implemented as the host of the APEC19, including the organization of a high-level meeting on disaster risk financing.The IFC manages a US$ 1.31 billion project portfolio in Chile. Of that amount, US$ 760 million originates from Bank resources and US$ 549 is mobilized from other investors. Most of the committed portfolio is in the financial (70 percent) and renewable energy (26 percent) sectors, with additional projects in agribusiness and services.

        Chile has been one of Latin America’s fastest-growing economies in recent decades thanks to a solid macroeconomic framework, which enabled the country to cushion the effects of a volatile international context and reduce the population living in poverty (on US$ 5.5 per day) from 30 percent in 2000 to 3.7 percent in 2017. However, more than 30% of the population is economically vulnerable and income inequality remains high.In the context of social unrest, GDP growth decreased from 3.9 percent in 2018 to 1.1 percent in 2019. The disruptions in economic activity resulted in an uptick of unemployment, from 7.1 in December 2018 to 7.4 percent in December 2019. Social unrest caused a change in the composition of public spending away from an investment promotion agenda and towards higher social expenditures. It also induced the government to call for a constitutional referendum currently scheduled for October 25, 2020.The current account deficit increased from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2018 to 3.9 percent in 2019 as lower exports more than offset a decline in imports caused by slowing domestic demand. As foreign investment dropped, the external deficit was financed by private and public external debt, which increased from 62 percent of GDP in 2018 to 70 percent in 2019. Over this period, international reserves increased slightly from US$39.8 to US$40.7 billion despite Central Bank interventions to prevent a higher nominal depreciation.The fiscal deficit increased from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2018 to 2.7 percent in 2019 due to additional spending in response to the civil unrest and the economic slowdown, dampened tax revenues and lower copper exports on revenues. The deficit was partially financed with fiscal buffers, but public debt increased from 26 to 28 percent, mainly domestic debt.The social unrest reflected widely spread frustration with high and persistent inequality of opportunities that prevailed despite significant improvements in social outcomes. Between 2006 and 2017, Chile had reduced poverty (measured as income below US$5.5 2011 international dollars per day) from 19.6 to 3.7 percent, and the vulnerable population (income between US$5.5 and US$13 per day) decreased from 43.9 to 30.1 percent. However, inequality of incomes, as measured by the Gini coefficient, remained around 0.44 in 2017, among the highest in the region. The growing middle class perceives high inequality of opportunities due to segmented service provision in education and health care and segregated labor markets. Jobs and higher wage premiums have largely gone to skilled workers, while workers with fixed-term contracts support a greater workload, have less job security, and have not been traditionally entitled to severance pay or unemployment insurance, though some of this has been addressed in economic measure to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations.The balance of risks is tilted to the downside due to uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 and the fluid domestic political context. Chile is exposed to lower than expected copper prices and longer subdued export demand resulting from the pandemic. Additionally, prolonged containment measures will likely impact on economic activity despite fiscal and monetary stimulus. Similarly, political uncertainty around the constitutional reform could weaken private sector confidence, dampening the recovery.In the medium term, Chile needs to reach political consensus on a policy response to social demands, while not eroding Chile’s traditionally sound macroeconomic management. Chile also should promote productivity gains at the bottom of the income distribution, including by fostering innovation, enhancingthe link between education and the labor market, and promoting female labor participation. Reducing inequality of opportunity will be crucial to eliminate the persistent pockets of poverty and ensure social stability.

        Between Fiscal Year 2015 and Fiscal Year 2020, the World Bank Group contributed to achieving the following results in Chile: - Chile has utilized financing in the education sector to improve the quality and performance of higher education through performance agreements with between the Ministry of Education and institutions of higher learning. In 2019, quality standards were defined for career services based on an assessment of student mentoring programs and initiatives to support the transition to the world of work implemented by public universities.At the government’s request, the World Bank conducted an assessment of the distributional effects of the 2014 tax reform on the economy, particularly on income inequality, by quantifying the potential effects of the reform on the country’s income distribution profile. The report revealed that for the wealthiest one percent of the population, the tax reform led to an increase in taxes paid from 2.4 percent to 3.5 percent.During 2019 and 2020, the World Bank Group has been working with Chile’s Ministry of Social and Family Development, which is leading the implementation of a new local social management methodology in municipalities. Local social management is a performance evaluation method which improves the comprehensive supply of municipal social benefits and services in nearly 120 communities throughout the country (a third of Chilean communities). Through a single window, public servants are now in a better position to offer each beneficiary access to programs and cash transfers to those who qualify.In coordination with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the World Bank supports the Protected Middle-Class Program. In a context in which the Chilean middle class constitutes a growing percentage of the population, catastrophic situations have been identified for generating solutions through a public policy that responds to this group’s needs and that reduces downward mobility to a situation of vulnerability or poverty.Additionally, the Knowledge for Change Program provided information to implement key institutional changes and policymaking processes in the areas of public works; transportation; urban mobility and innovation in Santiago and Concepción; sustainable, efficient natural resource management; the institutional strategy to reform the water sector; and the national forestry and climate change strategy.Between 2017 and 2019, several studies were conducted in the framework of the Shared Study Program with the Ministry of Finance. These included:Technical assistance to the Budget Directorate with respect to international lessons for fiscal decentralization reforms at the regional government level.The public expenditure review was submitted in 2017 for the areas of health, education and innovation and development. The review identifies measures to improve public spending efficiency.The report Challenges and Opportunities for Ageing in Chile seeks to contribute to the country’s demographic projections and to support discussions on public policy focusing on the demographic changes the country has experienced.The Hospital Concessions Study assesses the current concession system in health and explores international experiences that can serve as an example for Chile to generate changes that have a positive impact on reforms, taking into account other realities that contribute to the continuous improvement of the Chilean model.Last Updated: Apr 16, 2020"

        Over the past 25 years, the Dominican Republic (DR) has experienced a remarkable period of robust economic growth. The economy continued its rapid expansion in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, and between 2015 and 2019 the DR’s annual GDP growth rate averaged 6.1%. Tourism, remittances, foreign direct investment, mining revenues, free-trade zones, and telecommunications have helped make the DR one of the fastest-growing economies in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, and as of 2019 the country was on track to realize its ambition of achieving high-income status by 2030.However, the global shock triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the DR’s economy, causing a sharp contraction in the second quarter of 2020 across critical sectors such as tourism, construction, and mining. GDP is expected to contract by 4.3% in 2020 and projected to remain below its potential in 2021 and 2022. The impact of the pandemic is putting intense pressure on both revenues and expenditures, but by 2021 a combination of economic recovery and improvements in the efficiency of public spending should help return the fiscal deficit to a sustainable trajectory. Meanwhile, effective debt management and the development of local capital markets will become increasingly important to safeguard long-term debt sustainability and limit exposure to foreign-exchange risk.Over the past decade, economic growth in the DR has substantially reduced poverty rates while supporting the expansion of the middle class. However, disparities in access to economic opportunities and public services remain deep. Poverty rates are persistently high in rural areas, and women face disproportionate challenges nationwide. The national poverty rate is projected to rise by at least 1.4 percentage points to 14.2% in 2020, and the middle class is projected to shrink by 2 percentage points to 40%. Public investment and targeted policies to accelerate the recovery of the industrial and agricultural sectors will be vital to foster renewed growth and reverse the increase in the poverty rate.The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the DR into its first recession in nearly 25 years. An estimated 40,000 jobs have been lost since March, with especially negative implications for poor households and informal workers. By late May, the employment rate had fallen from 76 to 67%, year on year. The government’s macro-financial response policies will benefit the formal sector, but most employment remains informal. Structural reform necessary to accelerate formalization include leveling the competitive playing field for new entrants, small firms, and local suppliers, and updating business regulations.While policymakers are focused on the urgent challenges posed by the pandemic, the DR remains at high risk from hurricanes, flooding, and other extreme weather events. Access to adequate water and sanitation services has improved since the early 2000s, but the DR’s exposure to climate change threatens these gains. Climate-change mitigation and adaptation efforts must be complemented by improved management of natural resources, especially the coastal and marine assets on which so much of the DR’s economy depends.As the pandemic recedes, investment in human capital will be vital to the DR’s continued growth and development.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) strategy in the DR is based on strengthening the conditions for equitable growth, improving service delivery to poor households, and building multidimensional resilience to economic and environmental shocks. Over the past decade, WBG engagements have targeted growth and competitiveness, public institutions, the electricity supply, human capital development, environmental safeguards, and natural resource management.As of October 2020, the World Bank’s US$495 million DR portfolio supported projects in the education, social protection, and electricity sectors. In March, the World Bank disbursed US$150 million from a contingent line of credit to support the government’s COVID-19 response, and another US$100 million in pandemic-related assistance was approved in June. WBG advisory and analytical work has contributed to improving fiscal management, competitiveness, resilience, trade, education, and public health. Current analytical work focuses on infrastructure investment, jobs, water and sanitation, social protection, and managing fiscal risks.The International Finance Corporation (IFC) DR program is the largest among Caribbean countries, with a portfolio totaling US$568.7 million in June 2020—including US$212.2 million mobilized to support the pandemic response. Target areas for IFC support include electricity, transportation, banking, and sectors with high employment potential, such as tourism. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) issued a US$107.6 million guarantee to provide political risk insurance for the development of a toll road designed to link tourist zones.The World Bank and IFC are strengthening their collaboration in areas such as electricity, access to finance among small and medium enterprises, the development of capital markets, and public-private partnerships, consistent with the government’s priorities. The dialogue with policymakers around a new WBG Country Partnership Framework focuses on navigating the uncertain post-pandemic global environment and laying the foundation for a new period of robust, inclusive, and pro-poor growth.

        Over the past 25 years, the Dominican Republic (DR) has experienced a remarkable period of robust economic growth. The economy continued its rapid expansion in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, and between 2015 and 2019 the DR’s annual GDP growth rate averaged 6.1%. Tourism, remittances, foreign direct investment, mining revenues, free-trade zones, and telecommunications have helped make the DR one of the fastest-growing economies in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, and as of 2019 the country was on track to realize its ambition of achieving high-income status by 2030.However, the global shock triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the DR’s economy, causing a sharp contraction in the second quarter of 2020 across critical sectors such as tourism, construction, and mining. GDP is expected to contract by 4.3% in 2020 and projected to remain below its potential in 2021 and 2022. The impact of the pandemic is putting intense pressure on both revenues and expenditures, but by 2021 a combination of economic recovery and improvements in the efficiency of public spending should help return the fiscal deficit to a sustainable trajectory. Meanwhile, effective debt management and the development of local capital markets will become increasingly important to safeguard long-term debt sustainability and limit exposure to foreign-exchange risk.Over the past decade, economic growth in the DR has substantially reduced poverty rates while supporting the expansion of the middle class. However, disparities in access to economic opportunities and public services remain deep. Poverty rates are persistently high in rural areas, and women face disproportionate challenges nationwide. The national poverty rate is projected to rise by at least 1.4 percentage points to 14.2% in 2020, and the middle class is projected to shrink by 2 percentage points to 40%. Public investment and targeted policies to accelerate the recovery of the industrial and agricultural sectors will be vital to foster renewed growth and reverse the increase in the poverty rate.The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the DR into its first recession in nearly 25 years. An estimated 40,000 jobs have been lost since March, with especially negative implications for poor households and informal workers. By late May, the employment rate had fallen from 76 to 67%, year on year. The government’s macro-financial response policies will benefit the formal sector, but most employment remains informal. Structural reform necessary to accelerate formalization include leveling the competitive playing field for new entrants, small firms, and local suppliers, and updating business regulations.While policymakers are focused on the urgent challenges posed by the pandemic, the DR remains at high risk from hurricanes, flooding, and other extreme weather events. Access to adequate water and sanitation services has improved since the early 2000s, but the DR’s exposure to climate change threatens these gains. Climate-change mitigation and adaptation efforts must be complemented by improved management of natural resources, especially the coastal and marine assets on which so much of the DR’s economy depends.As the pandemic recedes, investment in human capital will be vital to the DR’s continued growth and development. The 2020 Human Capital Index estimates that a child born in the DR today will be only half as productive over her lifetime as she would have been had she received a complete education and proper healthcare. The DR has made great strides in expanding access to education and healthcare, but the uneven quality of these services remains a major obstacle to broad-based economic growth and human capital development. To restart employment-intensive, pro-poor growth and enhance its economic competitiveness, the DR must strengthen productive linkages between domestic and exporting firms, reduce the administrative costs of the bureaucracy, improve the reliability of the electricity supply, and expand access to credit. How swiftly and effectively the government embraces these reforms will largely determine the pandemic’s long-term impact on poverty, employment, and economic growth.

        Projects financed by the World Bank Group have yielded substantial gains in critical areas, including:The rehabilitation of more than 500 km of power lines, which has reduced electricity losses and guaranteed 24-hour service to 105,000 people from poor households.The restoration of three dams in the wake of the Olga and Noel storms, which has strengthened flood control, the water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation, and environmental conservation.Investments in improving 24 irrigation schemes, which have benefitted 18,779 fruit and vegetable farmers while enhancing local and national food security.The restoration of water-treatment facilities in the cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago, which has provided over one million gallons of safe drinking water to 750,000 people.The launch of a wastewater treatment plant and a submarine outfall, which has improved sanitation and water quality for 139,000 people in Puerto Plata, a major tourist destination.The renewal of irrigation systems covering more than 37,200 hectares of land and the introduction of improved telemetry systems to measure the flow of river water, which will increase the agricultural output of more than 18,700 farmers.Training on participatory budgeting, development planning, financial management, procurement, contracting, and human-resources management for staff in 31 low-income municipalities, which will enhance their ability to provide vital essential services.Improvements in the national system for procuring and distributing supplies in public hospitals, which will help reduce the cost of antibiotics, insulin, and other lifesaving medicines.The completion of a learning assessment covering all third-grade students and the introduction of a competitive selection system and enhanced academic standards for new teachers, which will improve the quality of education.The establishment of an advanced legal framework for disaster-risk management, an epidemiologic surveillance system, and rapid-response mechanism, which will enable the swift detection and management of disease outbreaks.Training in accelerated judicial processes through the “100 Days Challenge,” which will make it possible to resolve more than 3,600 cases of robbery and gender-based violence within 100 days.The passage of an insolvency law to facilitate commercial restructuring and measures to simplify online business registration, which will enhance private-sector efficiency and promote formalization.Expanded access to finance for a total of 221,133 entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises, 57.6 percent of which were women or businesses owned by women, which will strengthen competition and alleviate gender disparities in the private sector.The provision of social protection benefits to 300,000 individuals and the first-time registration of 191,000 individuals in the national conditional cash transfer program, which will directly accelerate poverty reduction.Last Updated: Oct 29, 2020"

        AT A GLANCESince the 2000s, India has made remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty. Poverty levels are estimated to have declined from 21.6 percent in 2011 to 13.4 percent in 2015 (at the international poverty line), lifting more than 90 million people out of extreme poverty. In recent years it has undertaken important reforms to spur economic growth - introducing the bankruptcy code, implementation of the GST to integrate the national market and undertook a series of reforms to ease the conduct of business.Growth was, however, already slowing when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. This was mostly due to a combination of domestic issues - including impaired balance sheets in the banking and corporate sectors and weak growth in rural incomes – as well as the slowdown in global trade.After March 25, when a national lockdown, forced by the onset of Covid - 19, was implemented and several states imposed additional curfew measures, economic activity - particularly industry and services - slowed sharply. Real GDP contracted by an unprecedented 23.9 percent (year-on-year) in Q1 FY21.The response of the Government of India to the COVID-19 outbreak has been swift and comprehensive. The government implemented a national lockdown to contain the health emergency. This was followed by a comprehensive policy package to mitigate the impact on the poorest through various social protection measures as well as liquidity and financial support for small and medium enterprises.The impact of pandemic, however, as in most large countries continues to be severe.

Half of India’s population already live precariously close to the poverty line and any income and job losses will increase their risk of slipping back into poverty. The pandemic has also exacerbated the vulnerabilities for traditionally excluded groups, such as youth and women.Recognizing these challenges, India is reworking its social protection architecture to protect its workers, particularly informal sector workers, hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until now, 70 percent of its vast social protection programs focused on the rural poor.  Internal migrants who crossed state borders to work were not covered. The country is now pivoting from a social protection program with a primarily rural focus into an integrated pan-India system that encompasses the informal sector and the urban poor.The Indian Government has also announced range of other initiatives including – MSME incentives, infrastructure sector boost, Agriculture infrastructure, micro food enterprises, increased public employment outlay, special liquidity window, etc.To build back better, it will be essential for India to continue to keep a strong focus on reducing inequality, as it seeks to implement growth oriented reforms to get the economy back on track. The World Bank is partnering with the government in this effort by helping strengthen policies, institutions, and investments to create a better future for the country and its people. Economic OutlookBefore the pandemic, the economy was already decelerating. Real GDP growth had moderated from an average of 7.4 percent in FY16/19 to 4.2 percent in FY19/20  due to long-standing structural rigidities in key input markets; continuing balance sheet stress in the banking and corporate sector, compounded more recently by stress in the non-banking segment of the financial sector; increased risk aversion among banks and corporates; a decline in rural demand; and a subdued global economy. Although the government initiated several policy actions to arrest the slowdown, the pandemic accentuated the down turn and real GDP contracted by an unprecedented 23.9 percent (year-on-year) in Q1 FY21.In the fiscal year starting in April 2020, India’s economy is expected to contract by 9.6 percent, and recover only very gradually thereafter, with risks tilted on the downside. Weak activity, domestically and abroad, is also likely to depress both Indian imports and exports. The significant fiscal and other policy responses announced by both the federal and state governments are expected to provide some relief, mostly to avoid an even deeper contraction. But, a potential source of risk to this effort stems from preexisting financial sector weaknesses and high levels of NPLs, which have been amplified by the crisis.

Real GDP contracted by an unprecedented 23.9 percent (year-on-year) in Q1 FY21.The response of the Government of India to the COVID-19 outbreak has been swift and comprehensive. The government implemented a national lockdown to contain the health emergency. This was followed by a comprehensive policy package to mitigate the impact on the poorest through various social protection measures as well as liquidity and financial support for small and medium enterprises.The impact of pandemic, however, as in most large countries continues to be severe. The informal sector, where the vast majority of India’s labor force is employed, has been particularly affected. Half of India’s population already live precariously close to the poverty line and any income and job losses will increase their risk of slipping back into poverty. The pandemic has also exacerbated the vulnerabilities for traditionally excluded groups, such as youth and women.Recognizing these challenges, India is reworking its social protection architecture to protect its workers, particularly informal sector workers, hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until now, 70 percent of its vast social protection programs focused on the rural poor.  Internal migrants who crossed state borders to work were not covered. The country is now pivoting from a social protection program with a primarily rural focus into an integrated pan-India system that encompasses the informal sector and the urban poor.The Indian Government has also announced range of other initiatives including – MSME incentives, infrastructure sector boost, Agriculture infrastructure, micro food enterprises, increased public employment outlay, special liquidity window, etc.To build back better, it will be essential for India to continue to keep a strong focus on reducing inequality, as it seeks to implement growth oriented reforms to get the economy back on track. The World Bank is partnering with the government in this effort by helping strengthen policies, institutions, and investments to create a better future for the country and its people. Economic OutlookBefore the pandemic, the economy was already decelerating. Real GDP growth had moderated from an average of 7.4 percent in FY16/19 to 4.2 percent in FY19/20  due to long-standing structural rigidities in key input markets; continuing balance sheet stress in the banking and corporate sector, compounded more recently by stress in the non-banking segment of the financial sector; increased risk aversion among banks and corporates; a decline in rural demand; and a subdued global economy. Although the government initiated several policy actions to arrest the slowdown, the pandemic accentuated the down turn and real GDP contracted by an unprecedented 23.9 percent (year-on-year) in Q1 FY21.In the fiscal year starting in April 2020, India’s economy is expected to contract by 9.6 percent, and recover only very gradually thereafter, with risks tilted on the downside. Weak activity, domestically and abroad, is also likely to depress both Indian imports and exports. The significant fiscal and other policy responses announced by both the federal and state governments are expected to provide some relief, mostly to avoid an even deeper contraction. But, a potential source of risk to this effort stems from preexisting financial sector weaknesses and high levels of NPLs, which have been amplified by the crisis.

        THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND INDIAThe World Bank Group’s (WBG) seven decade-long partnership with India is strong and enduring. Since the first loan to Indian Railways in 1949, the WBG’s financing, analytical work, and advisory services have contributed to the country’s development. International Development Association – the WBG’s soft-lending arm created for developing countries like India - has supported activities that have had a considerable impact on universalizing primary education; empowering rural communities through a series of rural livelihoods projects; revolutionizing agriculture through support of the Green and White (milk) Revolutions; and helping to combat polio, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.   In FY18, the relationship reached a major milestone when India became a low middle-income country and graduated from International Development Association financing.COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORKThe WBG’s present engagement with India is guided by its Country Partnership Framework for FY18-22 (CPF).  The CPF builds on the  decades-long partnership and seeks to address the country’s development aspirations and priority needs identified in the Group’s Systematic Country Diagnostic for India. It aims to work with India so that the country’s rapidly growing economy makes much more efficient use of resources; fosters inclusiveness by investing in human capital and generating more quality jobs; and develops strong public sector institutions that are capable of meeting the demands of a rising middle-class economy. The CPF’s approach combines a focus on ‘what’ the WBG will work on as well as ‘how’ it will engage India in the process. What will the WBG work on?Promoting resource-efficient growth, including in the rural, urban, and energy sectors as well addressing disaster risk management and air pollution;Enhancing competitiveness and enabling job creation, including improving the business climate, access to finance, connectivity, logistics, skilling, and increasing female labor force participation;Investing in human capital through early childhood development, education, health, social protection, and rural water supply and sanitation. How will the WBG amplify the impact of its work in India?By leveraging the private sectorBy harnessing India’s federalismBy strengthening public institutionsBy supporting Lighthouse India to foster knowledge exchanges within the country and between India and the rest of the world. In all its activities, the WBG will seek to address climate change, gender gaps, and the challenges and opportunities afforded by technology.  WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAMThe World Bank’s lending portfolio consists of 105  operations with $27.1 billion in commitments, of which $18.5 billion is IBRD, $8.5 billion is IDA, and $0.1 billion is from other sources, primarily grant funding from the Global Environment Fund.  Roughly a third of the number of operations and 40% of the volume of commitments are either central or multi-state operations with the remainder consisting of state-specific operations in 21 of India’s 29 states.  The three largest portfolios are Transport and ICT (15  projects totaling $6.7  billion in commitments), Water (14  projects totaling $5.3  billion), and Energy (12 operations totaling $3.7 billion).  In FY19  the Bank approved 10  operations totaling $1.49  billion in IBRD.India has been the largest country in IFC’s investment portfolio for several years, with FY18 recording a further increase in commitments of $2.6 billion, growing at a much faster pace than IFC’s average growth.  As of the end of FY 18, IFC’s India portfolio - own account and mobilization - stood at $6.1 billion across 283 projects.  The World Bank and IFC work together in several areas, most notably in energy, transport, water and health.  IFC-Bank synergies have been particularly strong in raising financing for renewable energy, highlighted by the Government of Madhya Pradesh’s decision to set up the largest single-site solar power project at record low cost in 2017.  IFC and the World Bank had a similar collaboration under the government’s flagship Clean Ganges program for sewage treatment plants using hybrid annuity-based PPP projects. IFC led the PPP mandate and World Bank’s loan is helping provide payment guarantee to increase the private sector’s participation in this sector. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) does not have exposure in India.  It is presently engaging with the Government of India to explore opportunities for its guarantee products.The WBG has a strong analytical program to inform policy debate, provide analytical underpinnings for improving operations and strategy, facilitating the scale up of innovative solutions, and improving state capability. These include support for reforming the business climate at the state level, producing semi-annual development updates focusing on key macroeconomic themes in India, conducting an analysis of the relationships between jobs and spatial transformation, and providing knowledge inputs for state-level health insurance schemes.

        AT A GLANCESince the 2000s, India has made remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty. Poverty levels are estimated to have declined from 21.6 percent in 2011 to 13.4 percent in 2015 (at the international poverty line), lifting more than 90 million people out of extreme poverty. In recent years it has undertaken important reforms to spur economic growth - introducing the bankruptcy code, implementation of the GST to integrate the national market and undertook a series of reforms to ease the conduct of business.Growth was, however, already slowing when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.

        WBG financing supported India’s achievement of numerous results over the past five years, highlights of which include:Education: Since 2001, India’s Education for All program –WBG supported Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) - has brought nearly 20 million children into primary school. Between 2012-13 and 2015-16, the net enrollment in upper primary school has increased by 10 percent. There are now 102 girls for every 100 boys in primary school, compared to just 90 in 2001.Rural Livelihoods: Over the past 15 years WBG has invested $3 billion in promoting a unique approach to the development of rural livelihoods in India - by empowering poor rural women. WBG supported self-help groups have been successful in mobilizing 45 million poor rural women who have been empowered with skills, access to finance, links to markets, and help in business development.  Women are now taking charge, becoming entrepreneurs, and providing jobs to other women. They have also gained greater voice, food security, and better health and nutrition. Since 2013, they have leveraged $25 billion in financing from commercial banks.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation: Since 2000, WBG projects have contributed over $3.4 billion in financing for rural water supply and sanitation. This has helped about 36 million people in 40,000 villages—with populations ranging from 150 to 15,000—gain better access to drinking water. In addition, some 23 million rural people have benefitted from improved sanitation. Many projects have helped promote women’s participation in discussions around changing age-old sanitation behaviors, as well as in making decisions about the use and maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure. Rural Roads: Since 2004, World Bank financing totaling $2 billion has helped India’s National Rural Roads Program and state roads projects build some 40,000 km of all-weather roads mostly in economically weaker and hill states. World Bank support has helped introduce many reforms and governance changes in the program including improved institutional effectiveness of the road agencies, use of green and climate-resilient road construction, improved asset management that focuses on creating an efficient road network of good quality rather merely construction, improved road safety, and better delivery of the national program. India’s National Rural Roads Program has been recognized as one of the country’s top 50 achievements since independence.Health: World Bank support to India’s health sector began in 1972. Over the years, it has focused on helping India meet the health MDGs, improve child nutrition, and tackle the long-standing burden of disease. Over the last 2 decades, World Bank projects have increasingly focused on improving the quality of health services provided by the public sector. State operations to provide obstetric and neonatal care in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka contributed to decline in infant mortality of 30 and 36% between 2005 and 2015.  In Karnataka at least 80% of babies in the state, even in the most disadvantaged districts, are delivered by skilled health personnel, up from 39% in 2007.  Since 1997, WBG supported Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program has treated over 20 million patients and, in 2006-15 alone, averted 3.5 million TB related deaths. While India has the world’s largest burden of tuberculosis (TB), the TB mortality rate in the country has fallen by 50% since 1990, and the TB prevalence rate has reduced by 55%.  WBG support contributed to averting an estimated 41,300 new infections among high risk populations, equivalent to a 32% reduction from 2007 to 2015.  WBG has contributed to India’s strong response to HIV, which has been lauded as a global success story. India’s adult HIV prevalence rate has continued to fall - from 0.34% in 2007 to 0.26% in 2015.Nutrition: Since September 2015, WBG assisted Integrated Child Development Services Systems Strengthening and Nutrition Improvement Project has reached approximately 29.7 million pregnant and lactating women (PLW) as well as children aged between 6 months to 3 years across 162 districts in eight states. The program’s ability to provide timely and effective services within the critical 1000-day window has improved. This was done by introducing innovative methods to build the capacity of community nutrition workers (Anganwadi Workers), combined with behavior change communication, as well as by making innovative use of technology to monitor and manage the program.Agriculture: Over the past decade, WBG support has helped 2.3 million farmers in the rain-fed regions of Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand implement soil and water conservation measures and raise agricultural productivity. Lessons learnt have helped shape the Government of India’s Common Watershed Guidelines and the design of national watershed programs. World Bank has developed and improved, more water efficient irrigation for over 2 million hectares; productivity gains for crops ranging from paddy to horticulture; and an increase of over 200,000 farmers’ share of retail prices for several commodities by over 20 percent in Assam and Maharashtra states.Energy: Since 1993, a series of World Bank investments totaling over $2.5 billion, together with intensive support for capacity-building, has helped POWERGRID, India's state-owned power transmission company, emerge as the third largest transmission utility in the world. WBG has supported Madhya Pradesh’s government to set up the largest single-site solar power project in India, attracting private investments of about US$750 million, where the rigorous structuring of the project risk-sharing mechanism led to intensely competitive bidding that resulted in the lowest ever solar tariff bid—some 33 percent lower than lowest preceding bid—in India in 2017.

        Japan joined the World Bank in August 1952, the year after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. Starting in 1953, a number of projects were implemented in Japan with World Bank loans for the development of the nation’s economic foundation, such as electric power generation, basic industries development, transportation, water, and infrastructure.Japan hosted the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund for the first time in 1964, a symbolic year that clearly showed Japan’s post-war reconstruction and return to the international community. In the same year, the Tokaido Shinkansen (bullet train) Line started operation (loan amount: USD 80 million), and the Tokyo Olympics were held. In 1966, Japan signed its final World Bank loan, and graduated from borrower status in the following year.Japan strengthened its status as a creditor in the 1970s, and became the second-largest shareholder of the World Bank in 1984, gaining a greater voice as one of the most important partners.In 2012, moving toward recovery and reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, Japan again became the hosting nation for the Annual Meetings. As part of intellectual contributions from Japan to the world, topics of the Meetings include lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, and Global Health based on Japan’s experience of universal health insurance for more than 50 years.

        GovernorThe World Bank Group operates under the authority of its Board of Governors consisting of each member country’s governor (usually the minister of finance or the head of the country’s central bank). The Boards of the World Bank Group and the IMF meet once a year at the Annual Meetings.Executive DirectorThe Board of Governors delegates responsibility to the Board of Executive Directors for overall operation of the World Bank. The 25 Executive Directors work on site at the Washington, DC, headquarters. Five of them are appointed by the five largest shareholders (Japan is the second after the United States, followed by Germany, France, and the United Kingdom), while others are elected by other member countries every two years. Voting power in the World Bank is determined by a member’s share in the Bank’s capital stock, not a single vote for a single country.The World Bank Group President is elected by the Board of Executive Directors and serves for a five-year term, which can be renewed.Shares and Voting PowerThe World Bank Group has a weighted system of voting. All members of the Bank receive votes consisting of share votes (one vote for each share of the Bank's capital stock held by the member) plus basic votes (calculated so that the sum of all basic votes is equal to 5.55% of the sum of basic votes and share votes for all members). The voting power distribution differs from agency to agency within the World Bank Group.Japan holds 8.90% of shares in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with 8.43% of the voting power. It holds 8.55% of the voting power in the International Development Association, the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries. It has 5.87% of the shares and 5.58% of the voting power in the International Finance Corporation, the Bank’s private sector arm. And it has 5.07% of the shares and 4.21% of the voting power in the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.For the latest voting status, please visit the Voting Powers page.

        Jordan has done well at minimizing the health impact of the COVID‐19 crisis. Soon after the outbreak, the Government of Jordan announced a first set of measures and incentives to address immediate liquidity and cost of financing concerns for various sectors/businesses, and measures to protect vulnerable households. Nevertheless, domestic lockdowns, the global economic slowdown, trade disruptions, and the suspension of international travel are likely to have a sizable impact on the Jordanian economy. The unprecedented economic shock of COVID-19 has exacerbated existing structural weaknesses in the economy and unresolved social challenges and put pressure on country’s fragile macroeconomic stance. Key challenges to Jordan’s outlook include the prolonged decline in economic activity from domestic lockdowns, which could escalate high unemployment levels. The speed of economic recovery in the medium-term largely depends on the evolution of the pandemic and whether reforms are put into effect.These reforms are anchored in the Five-Year Reform Matrix that Jordan developed in collaboration with the World Bank and other development partners. The Matrix lays the foundations for sustainable, inclusive growth that can deliver on agendas involving jobs, youth, and gender. These medium-term reforms aim to make Jordan’s economy more efficient and reorient it toward export-led growth by creating a better business and investment environment. During the pandemic, reforms to support productivity and strengthen digitalization for the economy have been particularly useful.Economic performanceJordan’s economic growth slowed to 1.3% in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting only partially the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Timid growth during the quarter resulted from an improvement in net exports and the marginal contribution of government consumption, while overall economic activity remained constrained by weak private demand and muted government investments. Meanwhile, labor market indicators for the second quarter of 2020 reflect the significant disruptions of the COVID-19 crisis. The already elevated unemployment rate has risen to 23% in Q2-2020 compared to 19.3% in Q1-2020, while the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.4% during this period. Looking ahead, the pandemic will have as disruptive an impact on the Jordanian economy and its prospects as it is having on Jordan’s trading partners and the MENA region as a whole; its gradual recovery over the medium-term could capitalize on lower oil prices and a steady momentum for reform to increase efficiency and boost productivity.At the fiscal level, the pandemic is exacerbating the fiscal deficit, as revenue collection has subsided given the economic slowdown and domestic lockdown measures. Although the government has created savings— by curtailing the public sector wage bill—pandemic-related spending pressures and recurrent spending rigidities are limiting Jordan’s ability to confine the deficit. As a result, the overall central government’s fiscal deficit (including grants and the use of cash) widened to 4% of GDP during the first five months of 2020, almost twice as high as during the same period in 2019. The sharp deterioration in government finances, together with the slowdown in economic growth, has elevated levels of public debt in central government (including debt holdings of the Social Security Investment Fund) to 105.3% of forecasted GDP at end-May 2020. In the medium-term, the fiscal stance is expected to improve once economic activity gradually recovers.As for the external sector, the current account deficit (including grants) narrowed by 6.3% year-on-year during Q1-2020. For Q2-2020, an initial build-up of external sector pressure was alleviated: exports and imports returned to positive growth in June following contractions in April and May 2020. Remittance inflows, on the other hand, remained negative throughout the second quarter, while the suspension of commercial flights prevented any inflows of travel receipts. Although the decline in international oil prices will support a lower import bill, the current account deficit is expected to widen significantly in 2020 due to subdued external demand and its spillover effects on the domestic economy through a decline in exports, remittances, travel, and foreign investments.

        The World Bank’s Board of Directors approved the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Jordan in 2016 to cover the period FY2017–2022. The CPF lays out an ambitious agenda for growth, jobs, and greater inclusion, while helping Jordan address the impact of the Syrian crisis in various ways, including through the use of innovative financing tools. A Progress and Learning Report is under preparation to take stock of the implementation of the CPF. The World Bank Group has used concessional resources to support Jordan’s Syrian Crisis Response through an exceptional International Development Association allocation of US$200 million and the establishment of the Global Concessional Financing Facility. This facility has been used to help fund a number of the projects set up in Jordan since.At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank mobilized swiftly to help Jordan respond to the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic by tapping on its existing large portfolio and preparing several new projects. Its focus is on: (i) Relief: helping with the health response and protecting vulnerable households through social protection and health projects; (ii) Recovery: supporting businesses and Small and Medium Enterprises; and (iii) Resilience: helping prioritize interventions/reforms for private sector rebound, growth, and jobs. As of September 2020, the World Bank’s active portfolio in Jordan comprised 12 projects, valued at about US$2.7 billion in low interest loans, concessional financing, and grants. The projects span key sectors: A US$300 million Program-for-Results operation promotes Economic Opportunities for Jordanians and Syrian Refugees; a US$50 million Emergency Health Project supports Jordan in providing primary and secondary health services to poor, uninsured Jordanians, and to Syrian refugees. The US$200 million Jordan Education Reform Support Program expands access to early childhood education and improved conditions for Jordanian children and Syrian refugee children. A series of Development Policy Financing (DPF) loans, beginning with a US$500 million First Equitable Growth and Jobs DPF that promotes inclusive economic growth to create more jobs and expand the National Aid Fund cash transfer program to cover an additional 85,000 households. In June 2019, the Bank’s Board of Directors approved the Jordan Second Equitable Growth and Jobs DPF for a total of US$1.45 billion in order to continue policy reforms established under the first DPF to boost inclusive growth and job creation. A US$200 million Youth, Technology, and Jobs Project was approved to improve digitally enabled income opportunities for youth and expand digitized government services in Jordan. In addition, the Bank approved the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project for US$20 million to help prevent, detect, and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19, and to strengthen the national health system for public health preparedness. To address the economic impact of COVID-19 on Jordan’s economy, the Bank recently approved the Jordan Emergency Cash Transfer COVID-19 Response Project to provide cash support to poor and vulnerable households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan.Jordan also has a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF), the Jordan Inclusive Growth and Economic Opportunities Multi-Donor Trust Fund, with pledged contributions of US$51.5 million from the UK DFID, Canada, and Netherlands. The MDTF funds 13 recipient-executed and Bank-executed grants. International Finance Corporation (IFC)Jordan is the second-largest International Finance Corporation (IFC) investment portfolio in MENA, with a committed portfolio of US$982 million as of June 2020. The portfolio is made up of loans (72%), equity (9%), risk management (16%), and guarantees (3%). IFC’s strategy focuses on increasing private sector participation to support investments, jobs, and growth through direct investment; and supporting Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the implementation of key business climate reforms (in line with the country’s Five-Year Reform Matrix). In terms of PPPs, the IFC worked with the World Bank to modernize the institutional framework governing them, and has signed with a Cooperation Agreement with the government for establishing the Jordan Project Pipeline Development Facility (PPDF) that will help the government develop a pipeline of ready-to-invest projects. The PPDF is currently in its implementation phase. IFC is also acting as transaction advisor for the government on three active mandates: the King Hussein Bridge, New Schools and National Broadband Network. The current investment pipeline covers the water sector; Micro-, Small, and Medium-size Enterprise (MSME) financing; and export-oriented manufacturing and services. IFC is working with the government to reform the credit infrastructure framework to improve access to finance for MSMEs and broaden financial inclusion. It has assisted the government in modernizing the country’s insolvency regime, introducing a framework to secure transactions with movable non-possessory collateral and enhancing the credit reporting framework through the establishment of a credit bureau. IFC is also acting as transaction advisor on an additional, active mandate, namely trade: This project will improve the efficiency of international trade procedures by enhancing trade facilitation practices and removing regulatory and administrative bottlenecks to cross-border trade. This should reduce the time Jordanian importers and exporters spend crossing borders, leading to a significant decrease of trade transaction costs. Other new projects include a national quality infrastructure project to support the increase of exports; and mapping the investor’s journey, designed to streamline and simplify the process of starting a business in Jordan, in part by reforming the licensing regime and streamlining construction permit processes. IFC’s current investment pipeline covers the water sector, SME financing, and export-oriented manufacturing and services. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)MIGA’s outstanding gross exposure in Jordan stood at US$580 million as of September 21, 2020. Jordan remains MIGA’s largest exposure in the Mashreq region, and MIGA has been very active in the country’s PPP sector, having supported projects in water, energy, and transport. MIGA-supported projects in Jordan include gas power, wastewater treatment, Queen Alia International Airport, and bromine manufacturing. MIGA is working closely with the IFC advisory team to identify opportunities to support FDI flows into the transport sector.

The unprecedented economic shock of COVID-19 has exacerbated existing structural weaknesses in the economy and unresolved social challenges and put pressure on country’s fragile macroeconomic stance. Key challenges to Jordan’s outlook include the prolonged decline in economic activity from domestic lockdowns, which could escalate high unemployment levels. The speed of economic recovery in the medium-term largely depends on the evolution of the pandemic and whether reforms are put into effect.These reforms are anchored in the Five-Year Reform Matrix that Jordan developed in collaboration with the World Bank and other development partners. The Matrix lays the foundations for sustainable, inclusive growth that can deliver on agendas involving jobs, youth, and gender. These medium-term reforms aim to make Jordan’s economy more efficient and reorient it toward export-led growth by creating a better business and investment environment. During the pandemic, reforms to support productivity and strengthen digitalization for the economy have been particularly useful.Economic performanceJordan’s economic growth slowed to 1.3% in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting only partially the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Timid growth during the quarter resulted from an improvement in net exports and the marginal contribution of government consumption, while overall economic activity remained constrained by weak private demand and muted government investments. Meanwhile, labor market indicators for the second quarter of 2020 reflect the significant disruptions of the COVID-19 crisis. The already elevated unemployment rate has risen to 23% in Q2-2020 compared to 19.3% in Q1-2020, while the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.4% during this period. Looking ahead, the pandemic will have as disruptive an impact on the Jordanian economy and its prospects as it is having on Jordan’s trading partners and the MENA region as a whole; its gradual recovery over the medium-term could capitalize on lower oil prices and a steady momentum for reform to increase efficiency and boost productivity.At the fiscal level, the pandemic is exacerbating the fiscal deficit, as revenue collection has subsided given the economic slowdown and domestic lockdown measures. Although the government has created savings— by curtailing the public sector wage bill—pandemic-related spending pressures and recurrent spending rigidities are limiting Jordan’s ability to confine the deficit. As a result, the overall central government’s fiscal deficit (including grants and the use of cash) widened to 4% of GDP during the first five months of 2020, almost twice as high as during the same period in 2019. The sharp deterioration in government finances, together with the slowdown in economic growth, has elevated levels of public debt in central government (including debt holdings of the Social Security Investment Fund) to 105.3% of forecasted GDP at end-May 2020. In the medium-term, the fiscal stance is expected to improve once economic activity gradually recovers.As for the external sector, the current account deficit (including grants) narrowed by 6.3% year-on-year during Q1-2020. For Q2-2020, an initial build-up of external sector pressure was alleviated: exports and imports returned to positive growth in June following contractions in April and May 2020. Remittance inflows, on the other hand, remained negative throughout the second quarter, while the suspension of commercial flights prevented any inflows of travel receipts. Although the decline in international oil prices will support a lower import bill, the current account deficit is expected to widen significantly in 2020 due to subdued external demand and its spillover effects on the domestic economy through a decline in exports, remittances, travel, and foreign investments.

        Improved Municipal Service Delivery  The direct beneficiaries of the Municipal Services and Social Resilience Project are estimated at 1 million people, of which 28% are Syrian, 21% youth, and 47% female. Current investments span rehabilitated and new roads, lighting units to improve the security and safety of neighborhoods at night, and leisure spaces. Education Reform The Education Reform Support Program builds on the Second Education Reform for Knowledge Economy Project by expanding access to early childhood education, as well as by improving student assessment, teaching, and learning conditions for Jordanian children and Syrian refugee children. Its objectives are as follows: (i) to expand access and improve the quality of early childhood education; (ii) improve teaching and learning conditions; (iii) reform the student assessment and certification system that will focus on strengthening the Ministry of Education’s ability to measure and monitor student learning at all grade levels and bridge the gap between learning and certification; and (iv) strengthen education system management by focusing on support to the ministry and strengthen its capacity to manage an increasing number of schools and students (due to the expansion of early childhood education and enrollment of a large number of refugee children in Jordanian schools).Maintaining Health Services in JordanThe Emergency Health Project is a results-based project that aims to maintain and deliver health care services at Ministry of Health primary and secondary health care facilities, in addition to improving the efficiency of health services through capacity building. Uninsured Jordanians and registered Syrian refugees will benefit from the health services provided in health care facilities. A total of 1 million people will receive essential health, nutrition, and population services through this project.The COVID-19 Emergency Response Project aims to prevent, detect, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen Jordan’s national health system for public health preparedness. The project started out by covering the cost of the mandatory quarantine of more than 5,300 people in late March 2020 and will finance the procurement of critical medical equipment for COVID-19 clinical care management.Jobs for Women and the Youth The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development for Inclusive Growth Project helped create over 2,000 private sector jobs for the most disadvantaged women and youth; 62% of the beneficiaries came from outside Amman, where unemployment and poverty rates are high. Women-owned enterprises comprised 85% of the beneficiaries; youth, who suffer the highest unemployment rates, made up more than 45% of the beneficiaries.

        Political and Security UpdateThe administration of President George M. Weah will clock two years in office in January 2020 and will be taking stock of its deliverables in terms of social services and fulfilling campaign promises to the people of Liberia and what to achieve for the remaining four years. The government put into place its Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) at the latter part of the first year. The PAPD is guided by four pillars focusing on empowering Liberians through education, health, youth development and social protection, enabling private sector-led economic growth, supporting a peaceful society, and creating an inclusive and accountable public sector.During the period under review, the country’s economy was challenged with rising inflation as a result of significant depreciation of the Liberian dollar against the United States dollar and other factors. This hampered the Government’s ability to fully deliver services and meet other obligations. Consequently, the Government is working with its development partners to help it tackle the economic glitches, while instituting measures to promote growth and development, critical for sustaining peace and stability.Following the highly contested 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections that ushered in the George Weah-led administration into office, Liberia is bracing itself for the Senatorial Mid-Term Elections in 2020. The tenure of 15 out of 30 senators will be expiring and those seeking re-election will have to face the electorates. The Legislature has passed a bill for a national referendum to reduce the tenure of the President and members of the House of Representatives from six to five years and senators from nine to seven years. Dual citizenship is also included for the referendum.Economic OverviewLiberia’s economy is projected to contract by 1.4% in 2019, following the modest growth of 1.2% in 2018. Inflation reached 31.3% by August 2019, up from 26.1% the previous year. The non-mining sector is expected to contract by 3.4 per-cent in 2019, on the back of contraction in services and manufacturing and weak performance in agriculture, while mining sector is expected to grow by 7.8% due to increased production of gold and ore.The overall fiscal deficit of the central government widened from 4.1% of GDP in FY2017 to 4.8% of GDP in FY2018 and further to an estimated 6.2% in FY2019, reflecting low domestic revenue mobilization and high public spending. Tax revenues accounted for 12.1% of GDP in FY2019, which is low by regional standards. The wage bill increased to 10.1% of GDP or over two-thirds of total expenditures in FY2019, crowding out other recurrent expenditures, particularly the provision of goods and services in the social sectors and infrastructure spending. The larger fiscal deficit led to a rapid increase in public debt from 40.2% of GDP in FY2018 to 54.5% of GDP in FY2019.The Government is currently implementing wage bill reforms intended to reduce the size of the wage bill, going forward.Liberia’s current account deficit narrowed to 21.1% in 2019 from 23.4% of GDP in 2018. This was largely due to a decline in imports following the complete UNMIL drawdown, while exports of gold and iron ore rose.

        World Bank Group (WBG) EngagementThe World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Liberia, guides the partnership between the Bank and Liberia over the period FY19-FY24. The CPF focuses on human development and intangible capital, while keeping the balance with investments in infrastructure to consolidate successes of the previous Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and reinforce the impact of the WBG program aimed at building human capital and boosting private sector development.Specifically, the CPF places emphasis on strengthening institutions and creating an enabling environment for inclusive and sustainable growth through transparency and accountability in the public sector, support for commercial agriculture, and the development of micro, small and medium enterprises. The CPF supports infrastructure investments to foster more equitable nationwide development to improve access to basic services and will remain closely aligned with Liberia’s PAPD.The WBG Portfolio in LiberiaAs of August 2019, the World Bank active portfolio in Liberia is composed of 19 projects, financed from multiple sources including IDA (National & Regional) and sector specific/thematic trust funds. The value of the portfolio, including all sources of finance is just over $1 billion ($1,093.7 million), 80% ($873.5 million) of which consist of IDA resources (National & Regional). Contributions from development partners to active projects through single and multi-donor trust funds account for close to $220 million. Within this same period, 53% of the portfolio has been disbursed mainly towards the support of key infrastructure sectors (roads & energy), health systems strengthening & disease surveillance (Ebola), agriculture, youth development, waste management, and water supply.International Finance Corporation (IFC) in LiberiaIFC Liberia is focused on achieving private sector development through key investment and advisory initiatives. As of 2019, IFC investment in Liberia comprises of: (i) $18 million financing in four Liberia banks credit lines and Global Trade facility; (ii) $7 million in agriculture financing in the rubber and cocoa sectors; (iii) $9 million (out of $18.5 million) seed investment in West Africa Venture Fund (WAVF) for private equity investment to small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  In December 2018, IFC signed a 4-year $6m donor agreement with SIDA (Swedish International Development Corporation Agency) for IFC to implement 10 key advisory programs across key sectors. With this advisory engagement, IFC will work with the World Bank, Government of Liberia, and the private sector to improve the business climate and unlock key investment opportunities in the country.IFC’s on-the-ground presence since June 2007 has enabled it to scale up activities with discussions ongoing on a number of potential investments in agribusiness, power and financial services. The IFC Liberia advisory program (supported by SIDA) focuses on 4 key areas to be implemented from 2019 - 2022: i) agriculture value chain development, ii) trade facilitation, iii) improving access to finance, and iv) business climate reform. IFC’s investment portfolio is diversified across sectors however, has focus on agriculture and financial services sectors, which present viable and sustainable investment and employment opportunities.

The government put into place its Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) at the latter part of the first year. The PAPD is guided by four pillars focusing on empowering Liberians through education, health, youth development and social protection, enabling private sector-led economic growth, supporting a peaceful society, and creating an inclusive and accountable public sector.During the period under review, the country’s economy was challenged with rising inflation as a result of significant depreciation of the Liberian dollar against the United States dollar and other factors. This hampered the Government’s ability to fully deliver services and meet other obligations. Consequently, the Government is working with its development partners to help it tackle the economic glitches, while instituting measures to promote growth and development, critical for sustaining peace and stability.Following the highly contested 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections that ushered in the George Weah-led administration into office, Liberia is bracing itself for the Senatorial Mid-Term Elections in 2020. The tenure of 15 out of 30 senators will be expiring and those seeking re-election will have to face the electorates. The Legislature has passed a bill for a national referendum to reduce the tenure of the President and members of the House of Representatives from six to five years and senators from nine to seven years. Dual citizenship is also included for the referendum.Economic OverviewLiberia’s economy is projected to contract by 1.4% in 2019, following the modest growth of 1.2% in 2018. Inflation reached 31.3% by August 2019, up from 26.1% the previous year. The non-mining sector is expected to contract by 3.4 per-cent in 2019, on the back of contraction in services and manufacturing and weak performance in agriculture, while mining sector is expected to grow by 7.8% due to increased production of gold and ore.The overall fiscal deficit of the central government widened from 4.1% of GDP in FY2017 to 4.8% of GDP in FY2018 and further to an estimated 6.2% in FY2019, reflecting low domestic revenue mobilization and high public spending. Tax revenues accounted for 12.1% of GDP in FY2019, which is low by regional standards. The wage bill increased to 10.1% of GDP or over two-thirds of total expenditures in FY2019, crowding out other recurrent expenditures, particularly the provision of goods and services in the social sectors and infrastructure spending. The larger fiscal deficit led to a rapid increase in public debt from 40.2% of GDP in FY2018 to 54.5% of GDP in FY2019.The Government is currently implementing wage bill reforms intended to reduce the size of the wage bill, going forward.Liberia’s current account deficit narrowed to 21.1% in 2019 from 23.4% of GDP in 2018. This was largely due to a decline in imports following the complete UNMIL drawdown, while exports of gold and iron ore rose. However, these improvements were offset by a fall in net income and decline in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and donor transfers, and consequently gross official reserves declined from USD 333 million (2.5 months of import coverage) at end- 2018 to an estimated $280 million (2.1 months of import coverage) at end-2019.Liberia’s medium-term growth prospects are expected to improve as macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms get implemented. Following the expected contraction in 2019, GDP growth is projected to recover to 1.4% in 2020 and further to 3.4% in 2021, driven by the recovery in the non-mining sector and a moderate expansion in the mining sector.

        For the transport sector, a total of 246 kilometers of road connecting Monrovia, Gbarnga, Ganta and Guinea border were rehabilitated, reducing travel time by 50%, and improving access to the port of Monrovia. The road rehabilitation works created jobs for over 1000 unskilled Liberians, some of whom acquired technical skills through capacity building activities such as: on the job training in different technical areas. This sector saw the design of key policies (the National Road Fund Act, the Road Act and the Road Agency Act), development of a multi-modal transport plan together with a strategic investment plan, and road safety analysis coupled with road safety training for technical staff. Of major importance is the technical support for the operationalization of the newly established National Road Fund (2018), designed to allocate up to 40% of annual revenues towards road rehabilitation projects. Institutionally, operationalization of the Fund would also include the proposal of critical reforms within the sector and the development of the human capital necessary to transition the Infrastructure Implementation Unit into a future road agency.Under the energy sector, the Bank has supported electrification in Liberia with a programmatic approach aimed at scaling up grid and off-grid options. A 10MW thermal plant was financed at a time when the main hydropower plant was undergoing rehabilitation. Heavy fuel oil (HFO) storage tanks, and associated facilities, were financed to help the transition from high cost diesel to lower cost HFO. Along key corridors, the Bank has extended electricity to 15 communities and connected 46,500 households and 450 commercial customers (to date: 30,000 customers have been connected). To ensure the sustainability and efficiency of these connections, the Bank has also prioritized the expansion and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution. Beyond the main urban center, Monrovia, 16,200 people in remote rural areas of the country have benefited from stand-alone systems including: solar lanterns and small solar home systems. On the policy level, the Bank supported the development of an optimization hydropower study to link Liberia to the regional energy market allowing it to switch from a seasonal supply to a year-round hydropower/solar based supply of electricity. In addition, the future Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea (CLSG) line aims to: (i) increase the supply of cost-effective electricity during the dry season, (ii) increase revenues for the national utility, (iii) expand electrification to remote areas, and (iv) open access to larger markets nationally and regionally.In support of the health sector, the Bank has financed construction of critical infrastructure and capacity building. In infrastructure, a new hospital, the Redemption Hospital is under construction and will be the largest referral center for maternal and child care in the country. In addition, the Bank has also financed the construction of: (i) 48 isolation and Ebola treatment centers and maternal-child health centers; (ii) staff housing; and (iii) two student dormitory buildings (total capacity of 96 students) that include 2 classrooms buildings and a mini-lab for undergraduate medical students. In capacity building, training has been delivered to different health providers, including 45 post graduates in medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and surgery, and mental health care providers (first time in country). Financing has also supported comprehensive maternal health care at seven hospitals and one health center; and referral systems in targeted areas. A performance-based financing model has been adopted and launched in 8 hospitals across three counties. During and after Ebola, the disease surveillance has been a key priority under the World Bank program including coordination with in-country partners to reduce the impact of any future outbreaks that may be devastating to the country.In support for youth development, since 2017, the Youth Opportunities Project has enrolled 8,144 youth, 50% of whom are women. Through a productive public works and life skills support activity, the project has enrolled 7,344 beneficiaries in hard to reach communities in rural Liberia. Beneficiaries of this component have cultivated over 8,000 acres of farmland with a variety of food crops. The second component, Household Enterprise Support, has helped to establish 99 small businesses with training and business startup grants. The project has thus far graduated 440 youth from a Business Startup training.

        Donor CoordinationIn 2018/19 the World Bank was the co-chair of the Consultative Partners Group (CPG), an in-country donor coordinating body formed by heads of agencies. The CPG is a forum formed around key development challenges in the country whereby financing is coordinated with an aim to enhance development impact. In addition, the Liberia country program has received significant contributions from development partners. The Liberia Reconstruction Trust Fund has been financed by Germany (KfW), the United Kingdom (DFID), the European Union, Sweden (Sida), Irish Aid and Norway in support of: transport, energy, and waste management. In governance and human development, our key partners are the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union, and Sida. In health and education, major multi-donor trust funds like the Global Financing Facility (GFF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) have provided seed funding for core work in these sectors. Also in health, the GFF leads the dialogue (and convening joint missions) with development partners committed to the country’s investment case for maternal, child and adolescent health (USAID, Global Fund, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Government of Japan, The Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), International Planned Parenthood Federation and Last Mile Health). In productive sectors, Norway has been the only financier of the World Bank program, and in agriculture, a close partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) could double the recently approved STAR-P IDA program.

        Number of Active Projects11Lending FY21$58.82 millionIBRD $517.37 millionEU IPA $17.22 millionThe ongoing World Bank Group program in North Macedonia is being implemented under the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2019–23. It is based on three interconnected focus areas that will help the country to (i) improve the environment for a dynamic private sector and enhance export-led growth, (ii) strengthen human capital for inclusive development, and (iii) build sustainability.The CPF will address ways to improve the private sector environment through several projects, including: the Western Balkans Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, aiming to improve connectivity and integration with regional and EU markets, reduce trade costs, and increase transport efficiency; the Local and Regional Connectivity Project, focused on strengthening maintenance, security, and climate adaptation for local roads; and the  Agriculture Modernization Project, which will support productivity enhancements through investments in agricultural modernization and strengthen the agriculture sector’s readiness for EU accession. The CPF will also contribute to North Macedonia’s ability to improve the gap in human capital. Besides the ongoing Skills Development and Innovation Support and Social Services Improvement Projects, the new Primary Education Project will improve learning conditions in primary education while also mitigating and recovering learning losses generated by COVID-19.The CPF will address the strengthening of public financial management and accelerate the country’s transition to a more sustainable energy mix. The Public Sector Energy Efficiency Project will directly contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions through the energy-efficiency retrofitting of public buildings, which includes central government and municipal buildings and public lighting. With the Social Insurance Administration Project, the Bank aims to improve the quality of services in social insurance and strengthen the regulatory framework for people with disabilities and hazardous occupations. This CPF will rely on the Advisory Services and Analytics program to advance key reform areas and address critical knowledge gaps. This includes an Organic Budget Law to support the Government’s efforts to enhance public spending outcomes by improving the legal and institutional organic budget framework. Innovation and Competitiveness Ecosystem technical assistance aims to make the environment for firm-level innovation and competitiveness in North Macedonia more effective, focusing on firm support that includes the Government’s direct role and how it can crowd in the private sector.KEY ENGAGEMENTThe World Bank has mobilized several instruments, both financial and technical assistance, to support North Macedonia in managing and mitigating the impact of the pandemic. Through the Emergency Fast-Track Facility, €90 million has been approved to support the country’s efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19, strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, and mitigate some of the social consequences of the pandemic.In addition, the Government of North Macedonia provided a salary and social contribution subsidy in April, May, and June 2020 to adversely affected firms to enable them to meet their immediate liquidity needs, keep their employees despite losing clients and revenue, consider operational upgrading, and lead the economic recovery. The World Bank provided advice on design and implementation, such as the conversion of the otherwise refundable subsidy into a grant for company improvements that would help them recover from the crisis. In addition, the World Bank provided a €37 million loan by activating the Contingency Emergency Response Component of the Local Roads and Connectivity Project, which covered half of the €80 million cost (0.7 percent of GDP). This financing was limited to viable small and medium-sized enterprises. World Bank support also covered 50 percent of the social contributions of employees in viable firms in the most affected sectors: tourism and transport.  About 20,000 companies (one-third of all active companies) with over 120,000 employees (one-third of all private sector employees) received the subsidies. To ensure transparency and proper usage, the Government published a list of all recipients and followed up to ensure that companies indeed used the subsidies to pay for employee salaries. This measure has cushioned the effects of the slowdown on the Macedonian labor market, preserving 80 percent of the most vulnerable jobs. Only 3 percent of private sector jobs have been lost since the beginning of the crisis.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsThe robust growth of 2019 was swiftly reversed by mid-2020 as the pandemic unfolded. Growth declined by 6.4 percent by June; manufacturing fell by 16.1 percent year-on-year (y-o-y), with only a handful of sectors observing growth. Trade, tourism, and transport, the main drivers of growth over the past several years, fell by 12.3 percent y-o-y. The decline in private construction was offset by public investment in roads. Agriculture and information and communications technology (ICT) observed a robust growth.  On the demand side, gross investments and private consumption fell sharply, while exports declined by one-third, almost entirely explained by foreign direct investment–related exports. The accompanying decline in imports alleviated the pressure on the current account deficit, which remained largely unchanged compared to 2019. Despite government support to cushion the pandemic’s impact on the labor market, by June, 17,690 people had lost their jobs. The unemployment rate, at 16.7 percent, increased for the first time since end-2011.  The banking sector liquidity ratio in the second quarter of 2020 increased due to central bank measures. Credit continued growing at 6.6 percent y-o-y by June, on account of both household and firm credits that were bolstered by strong deposit growth and crisis-support programs. Nonperforming loans remained unchanged at 4.6 percent, given the reclassification moratorium until December. The banking sector remained well capitalized (capital adequacy ratio at 16.5 percent) despite the bankruptcy of one bank in August 2020. Inflation remained low at 0.5 percent y-o-y by mid-year, reflecting the subdued output. The fiscal deficit tripled to 4.7 percent of GDP by July. The drop in value added tax and excise revenues of over 14 percent y-o-y was cushioned somewhat by an increase in social contributions as the Government subsidized employment. Spending increased by more than 10 percent y-o-y, as health expenditures and subsidy schemes, aimed at employment retention, surged. Spending on wages and pensions also increased, while capital spending declined by one-third. The Government was able to secure financing to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis and refinance payments that had come due. Public and publicly guaranteed debt increased to 59.5 percent of GDP in June 2020. Economic OutlookThe economy is facing a recession of 4.1 percent in 2020, the biggest drop since 2001. The contraction  in demand and disruptions in the supply chains caused by the prolonged pandemic and containment measures have been worse than anticipated. Unemployment is set to grow despite government support schemes, while private investment has been severely affected as investors struggle with demand losses and liquidity shortages. Services continued to be affected by travel bans.  In the absence of a government response, the combined effect of lower labor incomes and remittances will increase poverty to pre-2015 levels of approximately 23 percent in 2020. Many of those falling into poverty were not benefiting from any social protection programs before the pandemic. Support programs introduced by the Government will likely alleviate the poverty impact of the crisis.  Over the medium term, growth is expected to return as the outbreak loses force. Political stability after the general elections and the launch of EU accession negotiations should boost reforms and investor confidence so that once the crisis is over, growth can rebound more quickly. In this scenario of a gradual recovery, growth in 2021 is expected to reach 3.6 percent, as restored consumer and investor confidence pushes up personal consumption, private investment, and exports. Setting public finances back on a sustainable path will be needed over the medium term, as well as reprioritizing spending for longer-term recovery and boosting revenues by cutting back on exemptions. On the structural side, while mitigating the immediate impact of the crisis, it will be critical to address the low and declining human capital, the weak competition policy and judicial system, declining productivity, and rising migration.

        The Philippines is one of the most dynamic economies in the East Asia Pacific region. With increasing urbanization, a growing middle class, and a large and young population, the Philippines’ economic dynamism is rooted in strong consumer demand supported by a vibrant labor market and robust remittances. Business activities are buoyant with notable performance in the services sector including the business process outsourcing, real estate, and finance and insurance industries.Sound economic fundamentals and a globally recognized competitive workforce reinforce the growth momentum. Having sustained average annual growth of 6.4% between 2010-2019 from an average of 4.5% between 2000-2009, the country is on its way from a lower middle-income country with a gross national income per capita of US$3,850 in 2019 to an upper middle-income country (per capita income range of US$4,046–$12,535) in the near term.Real economic growth, however, has been challenged by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and the strict community quarantine measures imposed in the country.  Growth is now projected to contract in 2020, driven by significant declines in consumption and investment growth, and exacerbated by the sharp slowdown in exports, tourism, and remittances.Nevertheless, economic growth is expected to rebound gradually in 2021-2022 assuming a containment of the virus domestically and globally, and with more robust domestic activity bolstered by greater consumer and business confidence and the public investment momentum.In recent years, the Philippine economy has made progress in delivering inclusive growth, evidenced by a decline in poverty rates and its Gini coefficient. Poverty declined from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 while the Gini coefficient declined from 44.9 to 42.7 over the same period. The ongoing increasing trend in real wages, which is expected to have a positive impact on household incomes—particularly those from the lower income groups—will be hampered by the impact of the COVID-19, with negative consequences also for poverty reduction in the Philippines.

        The World Bank Group’s (WBG) partnership with the Philippines spans almost 75 years, providing longstanding support for infrastructure as well as engagement in key sectors, including governance, social protection, agriculture, water resources, and disaster risk management. The WBG is also an active partner in helping spur private sector growth, expanding engagement with civil society, and promoting peace and development in Mindanao.On December 17, 2019, the World Bank Group’s Board of Executive Directors endorsed a new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the Philippines for 2019-2023. The CPF prioritizes investments in human capital (health, education, and nutrition), competitiveness and job creation, peacebuilding, climate and disaster resilience, governance, and digital transformation.It supports a cohesive approach to Mindanao’s development and intensify efforts to engage the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), including reconstruction support for Marawi. For instance, the Bank will support projects that link remote communities to main markets, ports, and key growth corridors; promote human development; and address drivers of conflict.As of end of August 2020, the Bank's active portfolio in the Philippines had a total net commitment of US$2.5 billion, consisting of 13 operations financed by eleven International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans, one large recipient-executed trust fund and one grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The IBRD portfolio spans various sectors: Urban, Resilience and Land (22%); Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment (22%); Social Protection & Jobs (19%); Agriculture and Food (14%); Social Development (11%); Water (5%); Transport (4%); Health, Nutrition & Population (2%); and Energy (1%).The Philippines’ trust fund portfolio consists of 65 active grants with total a commitment of US$172.2 million, which includes the large recipient-executed grants and GEF grants included in the active portfolio.The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has an active advisory service program focusing on enhancing the investment climate, public-private partnership projects, climate finance, financial inclusion, disaster insurance, and sustainable agribusiness.This year, the Philippine government has requested support from the World Bank to manage COVID-19 in the short and medium term. The World Bank has provided financial support through the following:US$100 Million Emergency COVID-19 Response Project to support DOH’s efforts to increase the capacity of the health system to respond to the crisis;US$500 million Emergency COVID-19 Response Development Policy Loan to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on poor and vulnerable households and provide financial relief to small and medium enterprises affected by the crisis.In addition, the Bank provided financing through timely disbursement of the US$500 million Third Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan and the Social Welfare Development and Reform Project.

        Since the Philippines government received its first World Bank loan in 1957, the Bank’s development projects in the country have produced significant results for its people.  In the past three decades, the Bank’s assistance has expanded to a wide range of projects and analytical work, policy advice, and capacity development in support of the country’s development agenda.Highlights of projects and results:The Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) has been helping raise rural incomes, enhance farm and fishery productivity, and improve market access throughout the country since it started in 2015. It has been supporting provincial planning, rural infrastructure, and agriculture enterprise development. It has been using tools such as geotagging, value chain analysis, and expanded vulnerability and suitability assessments to help guide public investments toward a modern, value-chain oriented, and climate-resilient agriculture and fisheries sector.The project has helped support provincial planning for priority agricultural commodities and investments in all 81 provinces of the country. Since 2015, the project has benefitted a total of 323,501 beneficiaries, of which 147,238 or 46 percent are women. A total of 260,485 beneficiaries are served by infrastructure subprojects including farm roads, irrigation, and water supply; and 63,016 beneficiaries by agricultural enterprise or livelihood subprojects. Once all the subprojects under implementation are completed, a total of 758,329 beneficiaries are expected to benefit. Results of a household survey indicate that farmers and fisher households benefitting from completed infrastructure and agricultural enterprise subprojects gained 36 percent increase in annual household real income.The Participatory Irrigation Development Project (PIDP) has been supporting the improvement of 58 irrigation systems throughout the country. Since it started in late 2009, the project has rehabilitated and modernized irrigation infrastructure that has been serving close to 126,180 hectares, benefiting close to 196,440 farmers and their families. It has also provided organizational development and capacity building activities to more than 924 Irrigators’ Associations. Between 2009 and 2018 when the project closed, the average paddy rice yield of farmers increased 17% from 4.27 metric tons per hectare to five metric tons in the wet season and from 4.48 metric tons per hectare to 2.26 metric tons per hectare in the dry season.The Bank has supported the government’s education agenda through the Learning, Equity and Accountability Program Support (LEAPS) project in the areas of early grade reading and math with a focus on disadvantaged children. The project has benefitted approximately 4.4 million students, teachers, school heads, and other Department of Education staff in terms of improved teaching and learning in reading and mathematics. Specifically, the project has trained approximately 34,000 Grade 1 – 3 teachers and 10,000 school heads in early literacy and numeracy teaching strategies. Good improvements have been recorded in reading and math scores of Grade 2 and 3 students. LEAPS has also successfully helped the Department of Education develop and roll out a department-wide financial management and operations manual—and has trained 14,121 target schools in the new performance incentive scheme.The Social Welfare and Development Reform Project II (SWDRP II) has been supporting the government’s conditional cash transfer program (CCT), known as Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, which helps low-income households invest in the education and health of children up to 18 years old. Given the project’s success, the Bank approved additional financing to SWDRP II for the period 2019-2021. The recently-approved Philippines Beneficiary FIRST Social Protection Project complements the ongoing SWDRP II in supporting the Pantawid Program and helping the government harness digital tools to modernize social protection delivery.The Pantawid program has made an significant impact on reducing total poverty and food insecurity among beneficiaries, and has grown to become one of the largest CCT in the world, supporting more than 4.3 million households as of April 2020. The program is being implemented in 145 cities and 1481 municipalities across 80 provinces throughout the country.The program is estimated to have reduced total poverty in 2017 in the Philippines by 1.3 percentage points: from an estimated pre-Pantawid rate of 19.8% to a post-Pantawid rate of 18.5%. In addition, the program’s poverty focus helped reduce national income inequality by 0.6 percentage point from 46.8% pre-Pantawid to 46.2% post-Pantawid. The Pantawid Program has increased gross enrollment rates for children ages 12–17 years by 4.9 percentage points from a baseline of 80.4%, and by 10 percentage points (from a baseline of 60.8%) for ages 16-17.The program is also helping to reduce the gender gap in enrollment between boys and girls ages 6–14 years by 30%. Pantawid is encouraging poor women to use maternal and child health services, such as antenatal care: nearly 8 in 10 pregnant women of Pantawid households have the recommended number of prenatal checkups. It also promotes safer birth deliveries performed by doctors and improved children’s access to health care, all of which have positive effects on the long-term welfare of beneficiary households.Most recently, the SWDRPII also made resources available for the DSWD to respond to the urgent needs of the Pantawid beneficiaries during the COVID-19 crisis. In response to the request from the Government of the Philippines, the World Bank approved to disburse all remaining balance of SWDRP II additional financing in April 2020 for the DSWD to provide timely assistance to Pantawid beneficiaries. Although the funds have been fully disbursed, the World Bank will continue providing technical assistance and quality assurance for the efficient and effective implementations of the Pantawid Program.The Pantawid beneficiaries  are selected through Listahanan, the national household targeting system for poverty reduction in the Philippines, which reaches three out of four households across the country. The objective selection of beneficiaries has helped ensure that government programs are better targeted for those who need them most.The poorest communities have benefited from projects that address their priority needs through a community-driven development approach. As of June 2020, the National Community-Driven Development Project (NCDDP) has covered a total of 18,781 barangays (villages) in 827 municipalities in 14 regions, benefitting 7.8 million households. It has funded a total of 27,333 community sub-projects, of which 97% have been completed. Around 37% of the sub-projects done by communities were access services (e.g. village roads, footbridges, footpaths), followed by social services (e.g. day-care centers, classrooms, health stations) at 32%. A total of 1,048,757 community volunteers have been mobilized with women holding 63% of leadership positions in the community volunteer committees.When the COVID19 pandemic hit the country, the project responded quickly in 2,566 barangays or villages in 123 municipalities, benefiting around 590,000 households.  The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) adjusted the existing Disaster Risk Operational Modality (DROM) guidelines of the project to comply with COVID19-related protocols which includes the conduct of community mobilization in small groups rather than general assemblies to ensure physical distancing. The menu of sub-projects was also expanded to support community-based activities in terms of preparedness and/or early recovery/early rehabilitation responses to the pandemic.  The preparedness response included (i) mobilization/organization of community volunteers into Barangay Health Emergency Response Team (BHERT) in accordance with the DILG guidelines; (ii) designation/ enhancement of existing community facilities to serve as isolation unit in accordance with the DOH protocols; (iii) provision of additional facilities and/or equipment to  enable the community health workers to detect possible cases of COVID19; (iv) installing community-based early detection and/or surveillance of COVID19 cases and persons displaced due to COVID19; and, (v) organizing a referral system for COVID19 treatment.  The early recovery responses could include (i) provision of temporary employment primarily through cash-for-work scheme; (ii) provision of capacity building/skills training for enterprise development, (iii) support for enterprise development and (iv) employment promotion.Through the National Roads Improvement and Management Project II, the World Bank has supported the country’s efforts to establish a road management system to ensure the upgrading and preservation of its national road network in an environmentally, socially, and financially sustainable manner. Implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the project has improved 295 kilometers and rehabilitated 1,200 kilometers of roads. It has awarded contracts to ensure long-term maintenance of these roads. More importantly, it has helped improve DPWH’s planning procedures and management effectiveness in maintaining the country’s road network.To strengthen the government’s capacity to address disaster risks, respond to and recover from natural disasters, the Bank has provided the Third Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan. The financing also supports urgent needs created by the COVID-19 crisis. This is combined with technical assistance to help enhance the capacity of national and local governments in preparing disaster recovery plans and developing strategies to finance recovery efforts. With its global expertise in post-disaster reconstruction, the Bank has been working with the government in helping develop effective disaster recovery programs and building back better infrastructure and communities.The Bank’s assistance has also extended to conflict-affected areas in the country, helping support better governance, access to services, jobs creation, and enhanced citizen security and justice. Supported by a range of development partners, the Mindanao Trust Fund-Reconstruction and Development Project aims to improve prospects for peace and development in conflict-affected areas in Mindanao by improving social and economic recovery. A total of 577 community infrastructure, livelihoods, and functional literacy in 314 conflict-affected communities.

        Singapore is a high-income economy with a gross national income of US$54,530 per capita, as of 2017. The country provides one of the world’s most business-friendly regulatory environment for local entrepreneurs and is ranked among the world’s most competitive economies.In the decades after independence, Singapore rapidly developed from a low-income country to a high-income country. GDP growth in the city-state has been amongst the world’s highest, at an average of 7.7% since independence and topping 9.2% in the first 25 years.After rapid industrialization in the 1960s catapulted the island nation’s development trajectory, manufacturing became the main driver of growth. In the early 1970s, Singapore reached full employment and joined the ranks of Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan a decade later as Asia’s newly industrializing economies. The manufacturing and services sectors remain the twin pillars of Singapore’s high value-added economy.The overall growth of the Singapore economy was 3.2% in 2018. Value-added manufacturing, particularly in the electronics and precision engineering sectors, remain key drivers of growth, as are the services sector, particularly the information and communications industries, which grew 6.0% year-on-year, and the finance & insurance industries, which grew 5.9% year-on-year.  Economic growth is expected to moderate in 2019, with the government forecasting a range of 1.5% to 3.5%, projecting the rate to be slightly below the middle of the forecast range.In 2017, Singapore launched the regional finance hub ‘Asia’s Infrastructure Exchange’: “the go-to place where infrastructure demand and supply can connect, where infrastructure expertise and financing can be obtained and infrastructure needs are met.” In its announcement, the government highlighted the country’s strong ecosystem, one that integrates infrastructure players along the whole value chain – multilateral banks, private financiers, lawyers, accountants, engineers and other professional services.In the most recent World Bank Human Capital Index, Singapore ranks the best country in the world in human capital development. This means that a child born today in Singapore will be 88% as productive when she grows up, as if she enjoyed complete education and full health. Together with strong financial support from the government, the country continues to strengthen the nimbleness and flexibility of its workforce by providing continuing education such as the Skillsfuture initiative. Government spending on continuing education will nearly double, to more than S$1 billion yearly.

        Singapore became the 104th member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) on August 3, 1966. Prior to joining the World Bank Group, Singapore had received its first loan in 1963 under guarantee from the U.K. Government, and its second loan under guarantee from the Malaysian Federation, to which it then belonged. It received its third loan in 1966 after independence.Over the period 1963 to 1975, Singapore received 14 loans from the World Bank. The first ten were exclusively in the infrastructure sectors and included water interconnection, port expansion, sewage, power and telecommunications - reflecting the recommendations of a World Bank analysis in 1963 of Singapore's economy. “Most important for Singapore’s economic future in the long run,\" the report explained, \"(are the government’s) investments in the economy’s infrastructure, (which) will shape the framework within which development takes place.”By 1970, Singapore's development focus expanded to investments in human capital and in the services sector, with the Bank supporting the capitalization of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), the establishment of environmental management programs, and for the development of the national university. Support to infrastructure projects continued throughout.1975 saw the last World Bank financing for Singapore. By the mid-1980s, the loans were repaid.  Today Singapore is a member of all five World Bank Group institutions, and an important contributor of global initiatives such as the Global Infrastructure Facility, to which it contributed US $10 million, and the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities. It inspires many cities and countries striving to reach a similar level of development within one generation.The World Bank Group Singapore office opened in September 1999 to share knowledge with local networks. In 2009, the office expanded with the establishment of the World Bank - Singapore Urban Hub, aimed to leverage the country’s expertise in sustainable urban development.An agreement was struck in September 2011 to expand the partnership, and representatives from both the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) soon joined the Hub to strengthen its engagement with the private sector. The Hub's expansion continued, to include the Corporate Finance and Risk Management unit, IFC Treasury, IFC’s Asset Management Company, and the Global Infrastructure Facility.On October 27, 2015, the agreement for the expansion of the World Bank Singapore Hub for Infrastructure and Urban Development was signed, and the Hub - co-locating the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA - is the largest international organization based in Singapore. Today, Singapore’s transformation into an international center for infrastructure finance, trade, and urban development, combined with World Bank Group expertise, helps inform the preparation of development solutions - including credit enhancements for infrastructure development - to client countries in the East Asia Pacific region and also countries in South Asia.

        The World Bank Singapore Hub for Infrastructure and Urban Development promotes synergies across the World Bank Group, the co-location of teams from IBRD, IFC and MIGA. The Infrastructure, PPPs, and Guarantees (IPG) group and the Global Infrastructure Facility work in partnership with staff from the Global Practices, including Energy and Extractives, Transport and Digital Development, Urban Development, and Water, making the Singapore office a true infrastructure hub. Together, the teams mobilize cross-GP support to initiatives in Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, the Philippines, Cambodia, and the Pacific Island countries. IFC is also well represented at the Hub, with IFC Treasury operating a trading office and IFC Advisory Services for PPPs having its Asia hub here. Focused on advancing cross-border investments and mobilization of capital from and through Singapore, IFC also promotes urban development and the scaling up of disruptive technologies and new business models. Additionally, IFC engages with regional agribusiness players to promote sustainable practices.The World Bank Group in October 2018 signed an MoU with the Singapore government’s newly established Infrastructure Asia. Infrastructure Asia was established in 2017 by Enterprise Singapore, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a facilitation office for infrastructure and financing needs in the region, positioning Singapore as the regional infrastructure finance hub.This MoU is designed to bring about cross-learning benefits to both the World Bank Group and the Singapore infrastructure ecosystem, through leveraging networks, expertise and knowledge, in areas of knowledge exchange, infrastructure finance, implementation and operations. This includes various knowledge exchange programs, and the revamped Infrastructure Finance Summit, which is now in its 9th year running, with nine finance ministers from ASEAN countries participating last year.An MoU was also signed in April 2019 between the World Bank and the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore’s water agency, on continuing to be a strategic partner to the Singapore International Water Week for 2020, 2022, and 2024.The World Bank Group remains Singapore's strategic partner in Singapore’s flagship knowledge events, such as the World Cities Summit, International Water Week and International Energy Week.The Hub also delivers important research related to infrastructure and connectivity. A report on ASEAN connectivity helped shape the updating of the Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC). The Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance, its Secretariat based in Singapore, will work across regions and disciplines to promote cooperation, knowledge exchange, and meaningful progress in the field of global inter-connectivity.

        The Switzerland desk at the World Bank Berlin office works to promote consensus around the international development agenda and build a platform for collaboration between the World Bank Group and Switzerland. It does this by promoting better understanding of the World Bank Group’s mission and activities and by building relationships with key stakeholders such as government, legislators, civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and the media.It also supports outreach activities, often in collaboration with Swiss partners, such as organizing and supporting conferences, seminars, and other events on development-related topics. The office serves as an entry point for groups in Switzerland wishing to contact World Bank staff across the world or access the plethora of information the Bank publishes, and it responds to media queries. It also seeks to increase opportunities for collaboration between Switzerland and the World Bank Group through co-financing, trust funds, and joint analytical work in sectors and regions of mutual interest

        Last updated September 2020Over the last four decades, Thailand has made remarkable progress in social and economic development, moving from a low-income to an upper-income country in less than a generation. As such, Thailand has been a widely cited development success story, with sustained strong growth and impressive poverty reduction. While Thailand has been successful in stemming the tide of COVID-19 (coronavirus) infections over the last few months, the economic impact has been severe and has led already to widespread job losses, affecting middle-class households and the poor alike and threatening hard-won gains in poverty reductionEconomic growth in Thailand is expected to contract in 2020 , which is among the sharpest projected declines in the East Asia and Pacific region, due to a decline in external demand affecting trade and tourism, supply chain disruptions and weakening domestic consumption. The outbreak will likely lead to severe job losses, particularly in tourism, due to transmission control and social distancing measures. The impact on household welfare is also likely to be severe. The number of economically insecure, i.e., those living below $5.5 per day, is projected to double from 4.7 million in Q1 2020 to an estimated 9.7 million in Q2 2020, before recovering slightly to 7.8 million in Q3 2020. The government has quickly responded with a fiscal package (6% of GDP), unprecedented in terms of size and range of instruments, aimed at supporting vulnerable households and firms. The World Bank stands ready to support the government’s COVID-19 recovery program with the full breadth of our instruments.In recent years, economic growth slowed from 4.2% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2019. The key drivers of slowing growth were weaker demand for exports reflecting the impact of US-China trade tensions, slowing public investments, and a drought, impacting agricultural production. Key development challenges also pose a risk to Thailand’s future growth if it wants to attain high-income status by 2037. These include weakness in education outcomes and skills matching, which risk future productivity and chances of the younger generation, and increasing spatial inequality, with remote areas falling behind in economic and welfare indicators.Poverty declined substantially over the last 30 years from 65.2% in 1988 to 9.85% in 2018 (based on official national estimates). However, the growth of household incomes and consumption growth both have stalled nationwide in recent years. This resulted in a reversal in the progress of poverty reduction in Thailand with the number of people living in poverty rising.  Between 2015 and 2018, the poverty rate in Thailand increased from 7.2% to 9.8%, and the absolute number of people living in poverty rose from 4.85 million to more than 6.7 million. The increase in poverty in 2018 was widespread - occurring in all regions and in 61 out of 77 provinces. In the Central and Northeast, the number of the poor increased by over half a million in each region during the same period. The conflict-affected South became the region with the highest poverty rate for the first time in 2017.Inequality – as measured by the Gini coefficient – increased between 2015 and 2017. During this period, average household consumption per capita grew, but the household consumption of the bottom 40% of the population shrank.According to the World Bank Human Capital Index, which measures the productivity level for the next generation of workers relative to their full potential if all education and health outcomes were maximized, uneven education quality is a big challenge for Thailand. A Thai child born today can expect to obtain 12.7 years of schooling before the age of 18. However, once adjusted for quality of learning, that only amounts to 8.7 years of schooling, indicating a gap of 3 years.Thailand’s adult survival rate between ages 15-60 is lower than over half of the countries where such data is available. Over the past 15 years, Thailand’s prevalence of diabetes and hypertension have tripled and quadrupled, respectively, and combined with high rates of road injuries, has negatively affected adult survival rate. Only 87% of 15-year-olds are expected to live past age 60.

        Last updated September 2020The year 2020 marks the start of the implementation of the new Thailand – World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY19-FY22. In 2019, the World Bank and the Kingdom of Thailand celebrated the 70th anniversary of their partnership. Since Thailand became the 47th member of the World Bank on May 3, 1949, the Kingdom of Thailand and the World Bank Group have built a strong and productive partnership which has evolved from one focused on traditional lending and advice into an innovative knowledge-based partnership that reflects Thailand’s dynamic middle-income status. The CPF supports Thailand’s 20 Year National Strategy (2017-2036) that focuses on key economic and social reforms to end poverty and boost shared prosperity.The overarching goal of the CPF is to support Thailand’s transition to an innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy. It has six objectives:Improving the business environment through promotion of competition and innovationStrengthening fiscal and economic institutionsEnhancing the quality of infrastructure investmentsAddressing climate change and water resources managementPromoting quality educationSupporting inclusion of vulnerable groups, particularly in the fragile, conflicted areas of Southern ThailandThe current World Bank portfolio in Thailand consists of Trust Funds and Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA). Currently, there are no loans in the portfolio. As of September 2020, active trust funds amounted to US$4.95 million with activities supporting the environment sector and peacebuilding in Southern Thailand. Eleven active ASAs including three Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) engagement cover macroeconomic analysis, marine plastics, education, social protection, poverty assessment and inclusion.Regionally, the World Bank is supporting Thailand in several priority areas including its continued leadership in the ASEAN marine plastic reduction agenda, and on regional connectivity in the Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar Vietnam and Thailand (CLMVT) region. On the former, the World Bank is helping to prepare an ASEAN Regional Action Plan on Marine Debris, under the leadership of Thailand and the ASEAN Secretariat. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the World Bank Group institution that provides financing to the private sector – is guided by its 3.0 strategy framework. Key focus areas for IFC engagement include (i) infrastructure, with particular focus on leveraging public-private partnerships; (ii) innovation to accelerate access and affordability of reliable broadband services and insurance products; (iii) green growth which places a premium on technology and increased climate finance to help Thailand produce a more resilient growth model; (iv) sustainable cross-border development; and (v) strengthening the enabling business environment so that it helps leverage greater commercial financing which maximizes public resources.

        Last updated September 2020Over the last four decades, Thailand has made remarkable progress in social and economic development, moving from a low-income to an upper-income country in less than a generation. As such, Thailand has been a widely cited development success story, with sustained strong growth and impressive poverty reduction. While Thailand has been successful in stemming the tide of COVID-19 (coronavirus) infections over the last few months, the economic impact has been severe and has led already to widespread job losses, affecting middle-class households and the poor alike and threatening hard-won gains in poverty reductionEconomic growth in Thailand is expected to contract in 2020 , which is among the sharpest projected declines in the East Asia and Pacific region, due to a decline in external demand affecting trade and tourism, supply chain disruptions and weakening domestic consumption. The outbreak will likely lead to severe job losses, particularly in tourism, due to transmission control and social distancing measures. The impact on household welfare is also likely to be severe. The number of economically insecure, i.e., those living below $5.5 per day, is projected to double from 4.7 million in Q1 2020 to an estimated 9.7 million in Q2 2020, before recovering slightly to 7.8 million in Q3 2020. The government has quickly responded with a fiscal package (6% of GDP), unprecedented in terms of size and range of instruments, aimed at supporting vulnerable households and firms. The World Bank stands ready to support the government’s COVID-19 recovery program with the full breadth of our instruments.In recent years, economic growth slowed from 4.2% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2019. The key drivers of slowing growth were weaker demand for exports reflecting the impact of US-China trade tensions, slowing public investments, and a drought, impacting agricultural production. Key development challenges also pose a risk to Thailand’s future growth if it wants to attain high-income status by 2037. These include weakness in education outcomes and skills matching, which risk future productivity and chances of the younger generation, and increasing spatial inequality, with remote areas falling behind in economic and welfare indicators.Poverty declined substantially over the last 30 years from 65.2% in 1988 to 9.85% in 2018 (based on official national estimates). However, the growth of household incomes and consumption growth both have stalled nationwide in recent years. This resulted in a reversal in the progress of poverty reduction in Thailand with the number of people living in poverty rising.  Between 2015 and 2018, the poverty rate in Thailand increased from 7.2% to 9.8%, and the absolute number of people living in poverty rose from 4.85 million to more than 6.7 million. The increase in poverty in 2018 was widespread - occurring in all regions and in 61 out of 77 provinces. In the Central and Northeast, the number of the poor increased by over half a million in each region during the same period. The conflict-affected South became the region with the highest poverty rate for the first time in 2017.Inequality – as measured by the Gini coefficient – increased between 2015 and 2017. During this period, average household consumption per capita grew, but the household consumption of the bottom 40% of the population shrank.According to the World Bank Human Capital Index, which measures the productivity level for the next generation of workers relative to their full potential if all education and health outcomes were maximized, uneven education quality is a big challenge for Thailand. A Thai child born today can expect to obtain 12.7 years of schooling before the age of 18. However, once adjusted for quality of learning, that only amounts to 8.7 years of schooling, indicating a gap of 3 years.Thailand’s adult survival rate between ages 15-60 is lower than over half of the countries where such data is available. Over the past 15 years, Thailand’s prevalence of diabetes and hypertension have tripled and quadrupled, respectively, and combined with high rates of road injuries, has negatively affected adult survival rate. Only 87% of 15-year-olds are expected to live past age 60.

        Last updated September 2020The World Bank partners with Thailand in meeting challenges that affect people’s daily lives through grant funding delivered in collaboration with local organizations, international bodies, think tanks and academic institutions.World Bank grant-funded projects have supported peacebuilding efforts in Thailand’s south, in which conflict has claimed 6,000 lives since 2004. Implemented in 27 communities, the project in the three southern provinces of Pattani, Narathiwas and Yala helped demonstrate the value of community development and capacity-building to foster understanding and improve the capacity of civil society to effectively engage with the state.Another grant-funded project aims to assist the Thai industry to reduce the use of harmful ozone depleting global warming gases. The HCFC phase-out project has enabled more than 80 small and medium size foam manufacturers to change their production technology to non-ozone depleting and low global warming impact alternatives. In 2020, Thailand signed a $5 million grant agreement in support of reducing the import and use ozone-depleting chemicals by 2023. Thailand has also joined the World Bank Group’s Partnership for Market Readiness, a global climate change alliance of more than 30 nations, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Thailand also received a grant of $3.6 million from the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility to manage and protect its forests.Under the Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) Agreement, the World Bank supported the Office of Insurance Commission’s self-assessment of current insurance regulatory and supervisory practices and provided advice on consistency with international standards. This helped foster an environment for the insurance industry to efficiently expand and to better protect the poor against risks and loss. Other completed RAS work includes improving Thailand’s railway sector, providing advice on Thailand’s doing business reforms, and enhancing the education sector’s public expenditure.The ASEAN High-Level Meeting on Human Capital Development was organized by the National Economic and Social Development Council, World Bank and UNICEF on September 9, 2019 bringing together high-level representatives from ASEAN member states to promote human capital development and enhance cooperation between ASEAN and international organizations. In addition, the World Bank organized three ASEAN Regional Workshops to inform the ASEAN Regional Action Plan on Marine Debris, with participation from the ASEAN member states. Biannually, the World Bank publishes the Thailand Economic Monitor (TEM), which reviews recent economic developments and provides an independent analysis of the near- and medium-term economic outlook. The TEM also provides advice on growth-promoting policies. Other examples of analytical work include:Thailand Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), an assessment of the most pressing challenges and opportunities in ending poverty and reducing inequalityWanted: Quality Education for All report, which highlights how improving education quality can increase labor force skills and productivityTaking the Pulse of Poverty and Inequality"

        Uruguay stands out in Latin America for being an egalitarian society and for its high income per capita, low level of inequality and poverty and the almost complete absence of extreme poverty. In relative terms, its middle class is the largest in America, and represents more than 60% of its population. Uruguay is positioned among the first places in the region in relation to various well-being indices, such as the Human Development Index, the Human Opportunity Index and the Economic Freedom Index. Institutional stability and low levels of corruption are reflected in the high level of public trust in government. According to the Human Opportunity Index constructed by the World Bank, Uruguay has managed to attain a high level of equal opportunities in terms of access to basic services such as education, running water, electricity and sanitation.In July 2013, the World Bank classified Uruguay as a high-income country. By 2017, the Gross National Income per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) amounted to US$21,870.Since 2003, the Uruguayan economy has had positive economic growth rates, averaging 4,1% from 2003 to 2018. Uruguay’s economic growth has remained positive even in 2017 and 2018, in spite of recessions experienced by Argentina and Brazil, thus departing from previous patterns when growth was synchronized with that of its main neighbors. Prudent macroeconomic policies and a commitment to diversify its markets and products within the dominant agriculture and forestry sectors have increased the country’s ability to withstand regional shocks.In order to reduce the dependency on its main trading partners, Uruguay diversified its export markets. In 2018, Brazil and Argentina, Uruguay’s traditional trading partners, only represented 12% and 5% respectively of the total merchandise exports. Nowadays, its main trading partners are China (26%) and the European Union (18%).Two main characteristics —a solid social contract and economic openness— paved the way to poverty reduction and the promotion of shared prosperity that Uruguay successfully followed in the last decade.According to official measures, moderate poverty went from 32.5% in 2006 to 8.1% in 2018, while extreme poverty has practically disappeared: it went down from 2.5% to 0.1% in the same period. In terms of equity, income levels among the poorest 40% of the Uruguayan population increased much faster than the average growth rate of income levels of the entire population. Nonetheless, there are significant differences: the proportion of the population below the (national) poverty line is still significantly higher in the North of the country; among children and youth (17.2% among children younger than 6, and 15% and 13.9% among the age groups 6 to 12 and 13 to 17, respectively); and, among the afro descendant population (17.4%).Inclusive social policies have focused on expanding program coverage; according to the World Bank, around 87% of the population aged 65 or more is covered by the pension system. This is one of the highest coefficients in Latin America and the Caribbean alongside Argentina and Brazil.The strong macroeconomic performance was also reflected in the labor market, with a historically low unemployment rate recorded in 2011 (6.3%). However, given the noticeable slowdown in economic growth, the unemployment rate increased to 7.9% in 2018.Despite recent progress in Uruguay, several structural constraints to growth remain, in particular in the areas of infrastructure investment, integration into global value chains and education/skills performance, which may obstruct the progress towards sustainable development outcomes.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) has backed Uruguay’s development process for more than 60 years through different instruments, including loans, insurance, donations, technical assistance and knowledge exchange.Uruguay is included in the countries of highest income among WBG active borrowers, and it demands, in particular, the following:the development of finance services and innovative knowledge to provide solutions based on the WBG’s experience in other countries;the use of integrated services with the participation of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); andthe publication of Uruguayan development experiences in web sites where the WBG can serve as a platform for the dissemination of successful reforms.Similarly, the WBG has a great interest in continuing work with a client such as Uruguay in order to:collaborate with a country in which equitable growth and the support of the poorest 40% of the population are fundamental values; and join efforts and search for innovative development solutions to assist the country and create positive externalities in knowledge that can be used by other WBG clients in Latin America and other regions.The work program for the 2015-2020 is structured around three pillars:Generate resilience to economic vulnerability and climate changeBack government efforts to redirect the social contract towards the youngEncourage a greater integration of Uruguay in the global economy       The World Bank Group (comprised of three institutions: IBRD, IFC and MIGA) has in Uruguay an active portfolio that amounts US$1.000 billion. The IBRD has currently six active operations:Four investment projects for an amount of US$185 million in the area of education, water and sanitation, agriculture and electronic government.One Results-Based Project (P4R) for an amount of US$136 million for road construction and maintenance.One loan for development policies for an amount of US$260 million, commonly known as “contingent lines”, which is yet to be disbursed. It is worth pointing out that this kind of contingent financing played an important role in improving the credit rating of the country, which obtained the Investment Grade early in 2012.The participation of the IFC is currently focused on priority areas, such as agro-industry (whose aim is that the most competitive Uruguayan enterprises take part in global value chains), infrastructure support, financial sector and innovation, considering small and medium sized companies (SMEs) as a crosscutting support pillar. The IFC’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes two projects related to agro-industry and Fintech valued at approximately US$13 million.MIGA portfolio amounts to US$439 million and it is concentrated in one operation in the financial sector.Furthermore, the project portfolio is complemented with non-reimbursable technical assistance, donations and different studies, such as water resource management in Uruguay, demographic changes, analysis on grain-export logistics chains and green growth, among others. The participation of the IFC is currently focused on priority areas such as infrastructure (barge transport, renewable energy), the financial sector and agro-industry (food production), with small and medium sized companies (SMEs) as a crosscutting support pillar. The IFC’s current portfolio in Uruguay numbers four projects valued at approximately US$101 million. For its part, in 2016 MIGA issued a US$439 million guarantee for the Uruguayan subsidiary of Banco Santander.Furthermore, its project portfolio is complemented with non-reimbursable technical assistance donations and studies such as water resource management in Uruguay, demographic changes, an analysis on grain-export logistics chains and green growth, among others.Last Updated: Apr 09, 2019"

        Uruguay stands out in Latin America for being an egalitarian society and for its high income per capita, low level of inequality and poverty and the almost complete absence of extreme poverty. In relative terms, its middle class is the largest in America, and represents more than 60% of its population. Uruguay is positioned among the first places in the region in relation to various well-being indices, such as the Human Development Index, the Human Opportunity Index and the Economic Freedom Index. Institutional stability and low levels of corruption are reflected in the high level of public trust in government. According to the Human Opportunity Index constructed by the World Bank, Uruguay has managed to attain a high level of equal opportunities in terms of access to basic services such as education, running water, electricity and sanitation.In July 2013, the World Bank classified Uruguay as a high-income country. By 2017, the Gross National Income per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) amounted to US$21,870.Since 2003, the Uruguayan economy has had positive economic growth rates, averaging 4,1% from 2003 to 2018. Uruguay’s economic growth has remained positive even in 2017 and 2018, in spite of recessions experienced by Argentina and Brazil, thus departing from previous patterns when growth was synchronized with that of its main neighbors. Prudent macroeconomic policies and a commitment to diversify its markets and products within the dominant agriculture and forestry sectors have increased the country’s ability to withstand regional shocks.In order to reduce the dependency on its main trading partners, Uruguay diversified its export markets. In 2018, Brazil and Argentina, Uruguay’s traditional trading partners, only represented 12% and 5% respectively of the total merchandise exports. Nowadays, its main trading partners are China (26%) and the European Union (18%).Two main characteristics —a solid social contract and economic openness— paved the way to poverty reduction and the promotion of shared prosperity that Uruguay successfully followed in the last decade.According to official measures, moderate poverty went from 32.5% in 2006 to 8.1% in 2018, while extreme poverty has practically disappeared: it went down from 2.5% to 0.1% in the same period. In terms of equity, income levels among the poorest 40% of the Uruguayan population increased much faster than the average growth rate of income levels of the entire population. Nonetheless, there are significant differences: the proportion of the population below the (national) poverty line is still significantly higher in the North of the country; among children and youth (17.2% among children younger than 6, and 15% and 13.9% among the age groups 6 to 12 and 13 to 17, respectively); and, among the afro descendant population (17.4%).Inclusive social policies have focused on expanding program coverage; according to the World Bank, around 87% of the population aged 65 or more is covered by the pension system. This is one of the highest coefficients in Latin America and the Caribbean alongside Argentina and Brazil.The strong macroeconomic performance was also reflected in the labor market, with a historically low unemployment rate recorded in 2011 (6.3%). However, given the noticeable slowdown in economic growth, the unemployment rate increased to 7.9% in 2018.Despite recent progress in Uruguay, several structural constraints to growth remain, in particular in the areas of infrastructure investment, integration into global value chains and education/skills performance, which may obstruct the progress towards sustainable development outcomes. The strong institutional performance in other areas, such as public trust in government, low corruption and a consensus-based political approach, together with a deep commitment to strengthening its institutional set-up, give the country a solid basis from which to continue renewing its social contract and put in place policies to address such constraints.Uruguay maintains an adequate macroeconomic framework but in a much more complicated external environment.For more data on Uruguay, visit the World Bank’s Open Data site. For more data on Uruguay, visit the World Bank’s Open Data site.

        The World Bank Group has worked alongside different Uruguayan governments in areas such as infrastructure, transport, agriculture, natural resources, education, sanitation and health. Translated into results, this means, for example: 12,300 new water connections in 12 cities, three water treatment plants in Minas, Treinta y Tres and Durazno, supplying 60,000 people; 5,300 Uruguayan producers with better productive capacities, among other achievements.Since 2010, more than US$1 billion have been approved in loans aimed at financing investments in infrastructure, agriculture, environment and institutional strengthening, as well as to increase the Government’s capacity to protect the most vulnerable sectors of the population from external economic shocks through contingent financing. Moreover, the World Bank has provided analytical and technical support.Finally, in relation to the development of financial services and innovative knowledge that may provide solutions among countries, the World Bank Group facilitated Uruguay’s participation in 20 South-South initiatives on different topics, such as: road maintenance and performance based disbursements with Morocco, ICT in education with Armenia, experience with the livestock traceability system with Kazakhstan, agricultural information systems with Mexico and health experience with Paraguay and Chile. In addition, Uruguay received delegations from Kyrgyzstan (who were interested in improving the information systems in their national electricity company), Zimbabwe/Botswana (for budget issues) Nicaragua (in order to improve statistical capability of the country) and Costa Rica (in order to share the experience on water management). Moreover, representatives from the private sector of Uganda came to Uruguay, sponsored by the IFC.The following are some of the results of the World Bank and Uruguay’s work:Climate Insurance: Various countries (not only from the region) have approached the World Bank in search of a similar solution to the one implemented with the Uruguayan government. In December 2013, the World Bank signed an agreement with the energy company (UTE), in which the former provided a hedge for 18 months in order to deal with the combined risks of drought and high oil prices. This transaction was designed to help the company compensate for any financial loss that may occur when the lack of rain reduces the volume of water in the reservoirs that supplies the electricity plants, forcing the company to resort to thermal generation, which has a higher cost and requires the importation of alternative fuels. This was the major transaction of this type in the market (US$ 450 million) and it was the first time that a hedging transaction on commodities was made between an emerging country and the World Bank.Responsible Production Project. Since 2005, the World Bank has strived to encourage small and medium sized Uruguayan producers to adopt economically and environmentally sustainable production systems and to work with technical improvements in soil management, water and biological diversity in order to contribute to the long-term sustainability of agricultural production in the country. This was done by orienting financial resources and technical assistance to individual producers or groups, interested in carrying out projects in their properties. The project financed 5,300 property sub-projects throughout the country, 86% of which belonged to small producers. Approximately, 28,000 people benefited directly, while 600 technicians were trained in sustainable development and comprehensive natural resource management. Additionally, the project managed to coordinate the work of more than 160 institutions.The Foot and Mouth Disease Eradication Emergency Project was a key contribution to achieve the status of a country free of foot and mouth disease after the outbreak in 2001. Uruguay recovered access to markets and contributed to the continuing profitability of producers. Approximately, 50,000 producers benefited from this project. Furthermore, and in order to avoid similar situations, the World Bank supported the development of a National Livestock Information System (SNIG), which allowed Uruguay to become the unique country in America, and among a few of the world, with 100% traceability of individual cattle. Presently, Uruguay’s Ministry of Agriculture, with World Bank’s support, has taken a further step in the development of agricultural technologies, developing a National Agricultural Information System (SNIA). This consists in an online platform that consolidates different data, such as: weather forecasts, early warnings, among others. The databases are already helping agricultural and livestock producers to mitigate weather phenomena impacts on their production. See related article.

        Bordered by Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria, Benin has a 121-kilometer-long coastline on the Gulf of Guinea, a population of close to 11.53 million (2018), and an average life expectancy of 61.2 years.  Benin’s economy is heavily reliant on the informal re-export and transit trade with Nigeria (estimated at approximately 20% of GDP), and on agriculture, especially cotton, which is the country’s leading export product.Despite steady, robust economic growth over the past two decades, poverty remains widespread owing to limited growth in per capita terms (only 1.5% on average during the period 2008–2018). The national headcount poverty rate was estimated at 40.1% in 2015 as against 49.5% in 2008 (based on the international poverty threshold set at S$1.90 per person per day in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms).Greater economic diversification, more efficient public spending, and a more equitable geographical distribution of resources would pave the way for lower poverty rates and more inclusive growth.Political ContextBenin is a stable democracy, despite some tension surrounding the legislative elections held on April 28, 2019. The most recent presidential elections held in March 2016 were won by the multi-millionaire cotton tycoon, Patrice Talon. The government currently enjoys an absolute majority in Parliament (83 deputies). In accordance with the party system reform approved by the National Assembly in 2018, several political parties and movements were merged to comply with the new Charter of political parties. Benin now has around a dozen State-recognized parties compared to over 200 parties prior to the reform. The next commune-level and local elections are expected to be held in May 2020.Economic OverviewThe short-term outlook is negative due to the global economic slowdown associated with COVID-19. External transmission channels will play a significant role, particularly the slowdown in the Nigerian economy in the wake of low oil prices and the overall drop in raw material prices, especially cotton. Based on estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investors have already withdrawn S$83 billion from emerging markets since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Capital outflows are likely to lead to a sharp drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) and to increased financing costs. The impact of internal transmission channels – reduction in consumption and domestic investment – will depend on contagion risk and the public policy choices made to combat the pandemic.Before the spread of the coronavirus, a crisis that will have a negative impact on economic activity and government revenue, Benin had recorded solid economic outcomes between 2016 and 2019, with average real GDP growth of 5.5%. But the decision taken by Nigeria, Benin’s main economic partner, to unilaterally close its land borders with its neighbors in August 2019 has dealt a major blow to economic activity in Benin. Indeed, despite the country’s relative resilience, economic activity slowed to 6.4% in 2019 from 6.7% in 2018 (representing per capita GDP growth of 3.5%).On the supply side, growth was driven by agriculture, thanks to extensive cotton production (+18%) in the first half of the year. Industry and services also contributed positively to growth, thanks to the increase in locally-generated electricity following the opening of a new power station. On the demand side, consumer spending and private investment were the major contributors to economic activity. Inflation remained moderate at -0.9% in 2019 owing to heightened agricultural output despite the rise in fuel prices.The fiscal deficit (grants included) fell considerably from 2.9% to 0.5% of GDP between 2018 and 2019, driven by the limited execution of externally financed projects that led in turn to a reduction in investment spending, while domestic and non-tax revenue flows compensated in part for the shortfall in customs revenue caused by the closure of the border.

        Bordered by Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria, Benin has a 121-kilometer-long coastline on the Gulf of Guinea, a population of close to 11.53 million (2018), and an average life expectancy of 61.2 years.  Benin’s economy is heavily reliant on the informal re-export and transit trade with Nigeria (estimated at approximately 20% of GDP), and on agriculture, especially cotton, which is the country’s leading export product.Despite steady, robust economic growth over the past two decades, poverty remains widespread owing to limited growth in per capita terms (only 1.5% on average during the period 2008–2018). The national headcount poverty rate was estimated at 40.1% in 2015 as against 49.5% in 2008 (based on the international poverty threshold set at S$1.90 per person per day in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms).Greater economic diversification, more efficient public spending, and a more equitable geographical distribution of resources would pave the way for lower poverty rates and more inclusive growth.Political ContextBenin is a stable democracy, despite some tension surrounding the legislative elections held on April 28, 2019. The most recent presidential elections held in March 2016 were won by the multi-millionaire cotton tycoon, Patrice Talon. The government currently enjoys an absolute majority in Parliament (83 deputies). In accordance with the party system reform approved by the National Assembly in 2018, several political parties and movements were merged to comply with the new Charter of political parties. Benin now has around a dozen State-recognized parties compared to over 200 parties prior to the reform. The next commune-level and local elections are expected to be held in May 2020.Economic OverviewThe short-term outlook is negative due to the global economic slowdown associated with COVID-19. External transmission channels will play a significant role, particularly the slowdown in the Nigerian economy in the wake of low oil prices and the overall drop in raw material prices, especially cotton. Based on estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investors have already withdrawn S$83 billion from emerging markets since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Capital outflows are likely to lead to a sharp drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) and to increased financing costs. The impact of internal transmission channels – reduction in consumption and domestic investment – will depend on contagion risk and the public policy choices made to combat the pandemic.Before the spread of the coronavirus, a crisis that will have a negative impact on economic activity and government revenue, Benin had recorded solid economic outcomes between 2016 and 2019, with average real GDP growth of 5.5%. But the decision taken by Nigeria, Benin’s main economic partner, to unilaterally close its land borders with its neighbors in August 2019 has dealt a major blow to economic activity in Benin. Indeed, despite the country’s relative resilience, economic activity slowed to 6.4% in 2019 from 6.7% in 2018 (representing per capita GDP growth of 3.5%).On the supply side, growth was driven by agriculture, thanks to extensive cotton production (+18%) in the first half of the year. Industry and services also contributed positively to growth, thanks to the increase in locally-generated electricity following the opening of a new power station. On the demand side, consumer spending and private investment were the major contributors to economic activity. Inflation remained moderate at -0.9% in 2019 owing to heightened agricultural output despite the rise in fuel prices.The fiscal deficit (grants included) fell considerably from 2.9% to 0.5% of GDP between 2018 and 2019, driven by the limited execution of externally financed projects that led in turn to a reduction in investment spending, while domestic and non-tax revenue flows compensated in part for the shortfall in customs revenue caused by the closure of the border.

        In December 2016, the new government adopted a National Development Plan for the period 2018-2025, with the aim of achieving the priority targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The development plan is based on 45 flagship projects and aims to improve productivity and living conditions.The World Bank’s program in Benin is guided by a partnership framework that is aligned with the government’s development plan. The framework is reviewed and renewed on average every four or five years. Approved in July 2018, the current framework covers the period 2018-2023 and revolves around three areas:structural transformation of the economy to promote competitiveness and productivity;investing in human capital;enhancing resilience and reducing climate-related vulnerabilities.World Bank Group commitments currently stand at $1.05 billion to finance 14 national projects. Six regional projects financed to the tune of $202 million complete this portfolio. These projects cover several sectors: budget support, tourism, urban development, access to potable water, community development and social protection, governance, environment, agriculture, storm water management, nutrition and early childhood development, empowerment of women, and energy.In addition, on June 26, 2020, the World Bank released emergency financing of $50 million to assist Benin in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank has also:stepped up implementation of the disease surveillance project REDISSE;mobilized $10.4 million for an emergency response project.The strategy of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, focuses on four pillars:partnering with financial intermediaries to improve access to finance for enterprises;providing capacity building to financial institutions to strengthen this sector and promote business growth;supporting the development of infrastructure to attract investments (in ports, the electricity sector, and telecommunications);strengthening the investment climate in collaboration with the World Bank, and scaling up rural access to water under public-private partnerships (PPP), while building local capacity in this sector.Last Updated: Oct 02, 2020"

        The following are some of the results obtained in the key areas of development, with World Bank financing.Social Safety NetsThe Bank financed a social safety net pilot program targeting the poorest households through the Decentralized Community-Driven Services Project (PSDCC):Monthly allocations of CFAF 3,500 (about $6) helped families from the selected villages keep children in school, thereby reducing the child labor among Beninese children employed as agricultural laborers in Nigeria.These households also benefited from income-generating activities. The program provided $4 million in regular cash transfers to over 13,000 poor households from 125 villages.77 communes in Benin benefited from this project, with direct support provided to close to 390,000 beneficiaries, 49.3% of whom were women.18,000 new poor households are expected to benefit from the project by 2022.AgricultureLaunched in 2012, the Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Project (PADA), funded by the World Bank ($31 million) and the Global Food Crisis Response Program ($15 million), has helped restore and improve the productivity of rice, aquaculture, pineapple, and cashew value chains and increase their value added. Additional financing of $45 million was allocated in 2017.As of March 2020, the total number of direct beneficiaries under the project had reached 307,296, surpassing the February 2021 target of 250,000. About 39% are women, against an end target of 40%.PADA financing has supported 269 micro-projects (68 led by women); these projects are yielding positive results across the value chains.A total area of 11,828 hectares of agricultural land was equipped with small-scale irrigation and drainage, against an end target of 12,678 hectares.Moreover, the project financed the construction of 200 warehouses and 65 drying areas, which helped to significantly reduce post-harvest losses, particularly for subsistence crops and cashew nuts.In terms of livestock, 714,753 small ruminants and 1,773,701 head of poultry were vaccinated under the project.Last Updated: Oct 02, 2020"

        The European Union, African Development Bank, United Nations agencies, bilateral donors, the World Bank Group, and the IMF are Benin’s key partners. Non-traditional creditors, such as China and the Islamic Development Bank, are also increasingly active. Since 2004, annual joint missions of the main donors have taken place. Together they monitor the implementation of structural and sector reforms. Government–donor reviews are regularly carried out at the sector level.

        Canada strongly supports the international community’s efforts to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity through inclusive, sustainable economic growth and development. More than half of Canada's official development assistance is channeled through multilateral institutions such as the World Bank that build consensus around common interests including socioeconomic development, humanitarian crises, and security issues.In close partnership with Canada, the World Bank Group has provided extensive support to vulnerable states such as Afghanistan and Haiti. Canada supports the Bank Group’s efforts to counter instability and promote security and a cleaner, healthier world.Canada is a leading member and valued partner of the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest countries. The successful outcome of the IDA17 replenishment could not have been achieved without Canada’s strong support. For IDA17, Canada was the 6th largest contributor to IDA on a grant equivalent basis.Canada's strategic aid priorities are strongly reflected in its contributions to World Bank-managed trust funds. In addition, between FY10 and FY14, Canada contributed to programs such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria; the Global Environment Facility; and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.

        GovernorCanada’s Minister of Finance, the Hon. Bill Morneau, is Canada’s governor for the World Bank and is responsible for the management of Canada’s interests in the institution. The minister exercises his influence by exchanging views with fellow governors at the annual and spring meetings of the Board of Governors and of the Development Committee, as well as by engaging in direct discussions with the president of the World Bank.Executive DirectorThe governor delegates day-to-day handling of Canada’s diverse interests at the Bank to the executive director for Canada. Executive directors reside in Washington and meet regularly throughout the year (normally at least twice a week) to review and act on lending operations, new policy directions, and financial matters. In keeping with the World Bank’s information disclosure policy, the monthly Board Calendar is a public document. At the Board level, Canada is responsible for its own interests and those of Ireland and 11 other Commonwealth countries. The Canadian executive director is elected to the Board by the governments of Canada, Ireland, and the Caribbean-region countries of Antigua & Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines. The Canadian executive director is supported in his or her functions by an alternate executive director from one of the Caribbean members of the constituency.Canada’s Department of Finance coordinates input from Global Affairs Canada and channels Canada’s unified policy advice through the executive director to the World Bank’s senior management.Shares and Voting PowersThe World Bank Group has a weighted system of voting. All members of the Bank receive votes consisting of share votes (one vote for each share of the Bank's capital stock held by the member) plus basic votes (calculated so that the sum of all basic votes is equal to 5.55% of the sum of basic votes and share votes for all members). The voting power distribution differs from agency to agency within the World Bank Group. For the latest Canada’s voting powers, visit the Voting Powers page.

        In many aspects, Costa Rica is a success story in terms of development. It is considered an upper middle-income country, which has shown a steady economic growth over the past 25 years. This growth resulted from an outward- oriented strategy, based on the openness to foreign investment and gradual trade liberalization.Costa Rica is also a global leader for its environmental policies and accomplishments, which have helped the country build its Green Trademark. The pioneering Payments for Environmental Services (PES) program has been successful in promoting forest and biodiversity conservation; making Costa Rica the only tropical country in the world that has reversed deforestation.The combination of political stability, social contract and steady growth has resulted in one of the lowest poverty rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the proportion of the population with incomes below US$ 5.5 per person per day decreased slightly from 12.9 to 10.7 percent between 2010 and 2016.The success of the country in recent decades is also reflected in its strong indicators of human development, which have contributed to move the country up the global ranks, higher than the other countries in the region.While these achievements are celebrated, the country needs to focus on maintaining the steady growth, and in continuing poverty reduction amid the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic which has hit hard Costa Rica.The country now faces the risk of a sudden interruption in capital flows. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to fall in 2020 to -5.4 percent. Poverty and unemployment are expected to increase, partly due to the impact of the health emergency on tourism and trade, plus a contraction in areas such as agriculture and construction. However, a rebound is expected by 2021 as restrictions are lifted and supported by accommodative monetary policy and reforms related to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) accession process, along with fiscal consolidation efforts.Two pressing development challenges stand out: the fiscal situation and persistent inequality. These challenges affect the basic pillars of the Costa Rican development model: inclusion, growth, and sustainability.The government has strived to address these problems and is committed to an inclusive society that guarantees the welfare of its people, supported by transparent and accountable public institutions.

        The World Bank and the Government of Costa Rica established a Country Partnership Framework (CPF) to strengthen the World Bank-Costa Rica relationship. This CPF reflects analytical underpinnings from the Systematic Country Diagnostic, and is the fourth prepared for Costa Rica.The preceding CPFs established a framework for a closer partnership between the World Bank Group (WBG) and Costa Rica based on mutual learning and knowledge sharing.The current CPF features a highly selective program that is organized around the following two strategic pillars:· Reducing constraints to productive inclusion; and· Bolstering fiscal, social and environmental sustainability.Based on this CPF, the WBG is supporting the Government’s efforts to bolster fiscal sustainability, increase the efficiency of its fiscal management, and strengthen its capacity.The active portfolio in Costa Rica includes four projects totaling US$952 million in net commitments. Cooperation includes a health loan in the amount of US$420 million to support the efforts of the Government to improve the availability and quality of the universal health insurance system.Other projects, approved on March 2020, will support the Government in their policy response during the health crisis and after to ensure fiscal sustainability. The Sustainable Fisheries Development Project in the amount of US$75.1 million will help fishermen increase productivity and sustainability, while the Fiscal Management Improvement Project in the amount of US$156.64 million will ease tax compliance and border-closing costs and improve expenditure management.Furthermore, last June a US$300 million loan was approved to support Costa Rica’s Government program to protect people’s income and jobs from the impact of COVID-19 (Coronavirus), benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs), reinforce fiscal sustainability in the aftermath of this health crisis, and to lay out the foundations for a strong post pandemic recovery by promoting green growth and low-carbon development.The WBG is also working toward a green and inclusive growth of the rural territories through mainstreaming sustainable management practices and decision-making support systems in “productive landscapes”; in other words, those territories that are productive both for their natural beauty and, also for the activities developed in them (agricultural, forestry, fisheries, tourism, and others). Support also aims to improve competitiveness of rural supply chains.Environmental and climate change interventions continue to be supported through trust funds, such as the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, Costa Rica’s REDD+ strategy, and Partnership for Carbon Market Readiness (PMR). In addition, support is provided to enforce a Sustainability Protocol at the Reventazón Hydroelectric Plant of the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity, an international example that proves it is possible to develop hydroelectric projects applying the industry´s best environmental and social practices. Support is also given to the country through the Disaster Risk Management Financial Strategy, which is expected to be approved in the next months.  Regarding energy and transportation electrification, the World Bank supports the initiative to transition towards an energy model that optimizes the use of native resources.The decarbonization of the industrial and transport sectors is sought through the progressive electrification and diversification of the energy matrix, in an environment of greater regional integration and opening of international energy markets. The following trusts support this undertaking: the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Korean Fund for Sustainable Growth, the Alliance for the support of the National Determined Contributions (NDCs) achievement and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). The training of technical teams and the design of financial instruments and sector plans outstand among the activities to achieve improvements, both in the regulatory framework for the electrification of public transport and in the integration of renewable energies in the electricity grid.

        Pro-Productive InclusionThrough the Higher Education Project, Costa Rica’s public higher education system benefitted by an improvement in access and quality. Enrollment in undergraduate programs has reached the target of more than 102,000 students; and in graduate programs more than 7,000. The total number of officially accredited programs in the four universities participating in the Project has also surpassed the target of 106.  In infrastructure, there are more than thirty construction projects finalized, including new schools and university buildings, research laboratories and dormitories. The benefits provided to the indigenous people stand out, where the number of indigenous students enrolled in the four universities doubled between 2014 and 2017.Through Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS) for the health sector, the WBG helped develop a roadmap to increase the efficiency and quality of health services over the short and medium term. The results of this RAS are used by the Government to develop a medium and long-term strategy to enhance sustainability and equitable access to services provided through the social health insurance.An array of analytical work has been completed in recent years, among others, a case study known as Primary Health Care Achievements and Challenges within the Framework of the Social Health Insurance, the Costa Rica Social Sector Expenditure and Institutional Review, research series on green and inclusive growth, a working paper titled A Behavioral Approach to Water Conservation, and a gender assessment.Pro-Fiscal, Social and Environmental SustainabilityThrough the project \"Strengthening of the Universal Health Insurance\", the availability and quality of the universal health insurance system was improved, and the strengthening of the institutional efficiency of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS). Under the Program for Results mode, objectives such as the reduction of waiting lists and the care of chronic diseases have been met. For example, the goal of 41 percent of patients with type II diabetes identified and with optimal clinical control was exceeded. The improvement in colon cancer screening also exceeded the goal by reaching 15 percent of the target population. In addition, expectations were exceeded in the percentage of surgeries performed on an outpatient basis where the goal of 43 percent was exceeded. One of the greatest achievements is in the expected percentage of the total number of health areas equipped with the Single Digital Health File (80 over 60 percent expected).Through Disaster Risk Management (DRM) programs, Costa Rica’s preparedness to respond to disasters has further improved with risk reduction and prevention programs. The regulatory and institutional DRM framework was strengthened with the introduction of a legal framework that requires all new public investments to follow DRM best practices and include a hazards assessment. This enhanced capacity of Costa Rica to implement its DRM program was supported by the WBG’s CAT DDO (Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option), which provided a source of immediate liquidity in case of disasters.

        Denmark became a member of the International Bankfor Reconstruction and Development — the World Bank — on March 30, 1946. It was among the first countries to get a loan to help rebuild its economy after the Second World War. Today, Denmark is a member of the five institutions that form the World Bank Group. Denmark and the World Bank work with other member governments to finance projects, design policies, and deliver programs to end poverty in the developing world.

The Governors, usually Ministers of Finance or Development, meet twice a year. They have the power to admit and suspend members of the World Bank Group, increase or decrease the authorized capital stock, determine the distribution of the net income of the Bank, and decide on the World Bank Group’s overall strategic direction. Non-political State Secretary for Development Policy Trine Rask Thygesen serves as Denmark’s Alternate Governor.World Bank Executive DirectorThe Governor Delegates responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day business of Denmark’s interests at the Bank to the Executive Director (ED) for Denmark. EDs reside in Washington and normally meet twice a week to decide on borrowing and financial questions, projects, and policies that impact World Bank Group general operations. Denmark’s representation on the boards of IBRD, IFC and MIGA is shared with Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. Geir Haarde (Iceland) is the ED representing the Nordic-Baltic constituency on the 25-member World Bank Board of Executive Directors, and Joergen Frotzler (Sweden) is the Alternate Executive Director.Shares and Voting PowerThe World Bank Group has a weighted system of voting. All members of the Bank receive votes consisting of share votes (one vote for each share of the Bank's capital stock held by the member) plus basic votes (calculated so that the sum of all basic votes is equal to 5.55% of the sum of basic votes and share votes for all members). The voting power distribution differs from agency to agency within the World Bank Group.For the latest voting status, please visit the Voting Powers page.For information on Denmark’s aid flows as a donor, please visit the Aid Flows Denmark page.

        Eswatini is a landlocked country in Southern Africa bordering South Africa and Mozambique, with a population of 1.2 million. Poverty levels have stagnated at high levels in the last five years, with 39.7% of the population estimated to have been living under the international $1.90 poverty line in 2016 and 2017.Eswatini has close economic linkages to South Africa, which it depends on for about 85% of its imports and about 60% of exports. Eswatini is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), with Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa. Under the CMA, the Eswatini lilangeni (the domestic currency) is pegged at par to the South African rand, which is also legal tender in the country.Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2018 is estimated at 2.4% from 2% in 2017, partly driven by a stronger-than-projected recovery in the primary and service sectors. However, due to escalating fiscal challenges (reflected through accumulation of domestic arrears) that are expected to continue slowing recovery in construction and public administration sectors, real GDP for 2019 is projected to decline to 1.3%.Wage costs have remained elevated as the fiscal situation continues to deteriorate. As a result, the fiscal deficit increased from about 5% of GDP in 2017 to 7% in 2018. It is projected to remain negative in the medium-term. Consequently, public debt has rapidly increased, rising from 10% of GDP in 2009 to hit around 30% of GDP in July 2019.The government also continues accumulating domestic arrears that increased from 3% of GDP in 2016 to 10.3% of GDP by July 2019. As a result, gross official reserves have been consistently below the three-month international benchmark, reaching a low of two months of imports of goods and services in March 2019.For the first time, inflation remained below the 3% lower-band threshold from April to August 2019 as the government has kept the price of housing and utilities constant for more than 12 months. During the first eight months of 2019, inflation averaged 3% compared to 4.6% recorded during the same period last year. Due to decreasing inflation the Central Bank of Eswatini maintained an accommodative monetary policy for the same period and further cuts interest by 25 basis points to 6.5% in July 2019.Development challengesPoverty has persisted despite the country’s lower-middle-income status. Nationally, 58.9% of Swazis lived below the national poverty line in 2017. This follows a decline from 63% in 2009, and 69.0% in 2001. By international poverty standards, 38.6% of Swazis lived below the 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) of $1.90 per person per day, and this rises to 60.4% when the 2011 PPP $3.20 per person per day poverty line for lower middle-income countries is used.Challenges to poverty reduction include slowing economic growth, adverse weather patterns, high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, high unemployment, and high inequality; the per adult equivalent consumption Gini index stagnated around 49.0 between 2010 and 2017.National elections were held in September 2018, which the Southern African Development Community and African Union Observer missions declared peaceful.

        The Country Partnership Strategy 2015-2018 (CPS) aimed to support the country’s efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, and to promote shared prosperity in a sustainable way. The Performance and Learning Review (PLR) was noted by the World Bank Board of Directions in August 2018. The PLR extended the CPS by two years to 2020, prioritizing two program pillars: (i) Promoting growth and productivity, and (ii) Strengthening state capabilities.The PLR found that ongoing projects and advisory services have been implemented successfully, with strong results. Several improvements have been registered in the health sector, including tuberculosis (TB) treatment success rate, increased safety net support to orphans and vulnerable children, and an increased number of health units providing the five basic services.Similarly, the Local Government Project has made notable progress in strengthening municipal and rural local government capacity for the delivery of local services and infrastructure.  Preparation of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is underway for delivery in FY20 and will guide the development of a new Country Partnership Framework.

        Delivery on technical and analytical work and implementation of ongoing projects includes:The Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan (FSDIP) was prepared under the leadership of the Central Bank, finalized in 2016 and subsequently launched. Its implementation is underway with a focus on stability, supported through the International Monetary Fund program and World Bank Group program on financial inclusion. The joint program is financed by the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative.The Health HIV/AIDS, TB Project, which closed in September 2018, contributed to improving access to quality of services, focused on primary health care, maternal health, and HIV/AIDS and TB, and increase the access of orphans and vulnerable children to the social safety net. The project also renovated and equipped selected health facilities including strengthening the referral and transport system. The Local Government Project, which closed in June 2019, contributed to institutional strengthening of local governments by enhancing financial management capacity as well as delivery of local services and infrastructure. Both projects have met, and in some cases exceeded, their targets.New projects are under preparation in water, energy and health, including the Network Reinforcement and Access Project approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in June 2019.

        Finland’s desk at the World Bank Paris office works to promote consensus around the international development agenda and build a platform for collaboration between the World Bank Group and Finland. It does this by promoting better understanding of the World Bank Group’s mission and activities and by building relationships with key stakeholders such as government, legislators, civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and the media.It also supports outreach activities, often in collaboration with Finnish partners, such as organizing and supporting conferences, seminars, and other events on development-related topics. The desk serves as an entry point for groups in Finland wishing to contact World Bank staff across the world or access the plethora of information the Bank publishes, and it responds to media queries. It also seeks to increase opportunities for collaboration between Finland and the World Bank Group through co-financing, trust funds, and joint analytical work in sectors and regions of mutual interest.

        The World Bank Group's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2013-2018  was endorsed by the Bank in September 2013. The CPS' objective was to assist the government to sustain economic growth, accelerate poverty reduction, and enhance shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.Lessons from the CPS and the 2018 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) will inform a new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) beyond FY20. The new CPF, seeks to help Ghana consolidate its transition to the status of a lower-middle-income country, address sources of inequality, improve human capital services and build stronger economic and management institutions and increase agriculture productivity and improve the business climate for industrialization. The CPF under preparation is based on three pillars: improved human capital especially in lagging areas; job intensive and sustainable economic growth and more effective and transparent governance and service delivery. These are anchored in the Ghana Coordinated Program of Economic and Social Policies Agenda, which include economic development, social development, environment, infrastructure and human settlement, as well as governance, corruption and public accountability.The total WBG exposure is approximately $5.091.5 billion, with a current portfolio of $2.1 billion of credits and grants from the International Development Association (IDA). The current International Development Association portfolio consists of 23 national operations with a total commitment of$2,057.57 million, and two regional operations with additional net commitment of $84 million in higher education. Of this, 42.3% has been disbursed with $1.125 million undisbursed.

        Ghana sits on the Atlantic Ocean and borders Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. It has a population of about 29.6 million (2018). In the past two decades, it has taken major strides toward democracy under a multi-party system, with its independent judiciary winning public trust. Ghana consistently ranks in the top three countries in Africa for freedom of speech and press freedom, with strong broadcast media, with radio being the medium with the greatest reach. Factors such as these provide Ghana with solid social capital.Two and a half years after being elected president in a peaceful election, President Akuffo-Addo has marked some successes implementing some of its promises such as planting for food and jobs and free secondary education. But he also faces challenges fulfilling some of his election pledges—including setting up a factory in each of the nation’s 216 districts, one dam for every village and providing free high school education.Recent Economic Developments and OutlookRecent Developments. Ghana’s economy continued to expand in 2019 as the first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth was estimated at 6.7%, compared with 5.4% in the same period of last year. Non-oil growth was also strong at 6.0%. The relatively high quarterly growth was driven by a strong recovery in the services sector which grew by 7.2% compared with 1.2% in 2018.The government continued with its fiscal consolidation efforts in 2019 even though there were still challenges in meeting the revenue targets. Fiscal performance for the first half of 2019 showed an overall budget deficit (on cash basis) of 3.3% of GDP higher than the target of 2.9% of GDP. This is because the revenue shortfalls of 1.6% of GDP was higher than expenditure cuts of 1% of GDP.Private sector credit grew stronger, supported largely by the well-capitalized banking sector. Inflation continued to be in single digits in the first six months of 2019; gradually rising from 9% in January to 9.5% in April 2019 but reduced to 9.1% in June 2019 mainly driven by low food inflation.Ghana’s current account in the first half of 2019 was estimated at a surplus of 0.1% of GDP supported by favorable trade conditions of Ghana’s three main export commodities—oil, gold and cocoa, resulting in a trade surplus of 2.8% of GDP. The current account surplus, combined with significant inflows to the capital and financial accounts, resulted in an overall balance of payments surplus equivalent to 1.9% of GDP. With the issuance of the $3 billion Eurobond in March 2019, the international reserves significantly improved in 2019 with Gross International Reserves (GIR) of $8.6 billion (equivalent to 4.3 months of import cover) at the end of June 2019.The Ghana cedi came under considerable pressure in the first quarter of 2019, due to high demand, as importers sought to restock their supplies but, in the second quarter, the domestic currency market became relatively calmer. The Ghana cedi cumulatively depreciated by 8.2% in the year to July 18, 2019.Outlook: Economic growth is projected to increase to 7.6% in 2019. Non-oil growth is expected to accelerate to 6% as the government’s new policies in the agriculture sector and the promotion of agribusiness begin to take effect. Inflation is expected to remain within the Central Bank’s target range of 6-10% over the medium term.The pace of fiscal consolidation is expected to slow in 2019 and the overall fiscal deficit is projected at 4.5% of GDP in 2019 and, in the medium term, it will remain within fiscal rule ceiling of 5% of GDP.Risks and Challenges: Maintaining a fiscal consolidation stance and staying on a sustainable path through the 2020 election cycle will be a challenge over the next two years. Also, Ghana’s energy sector is in dire financial conditions and without remedy, this poses serious fiscal risks in the coming years. The sector is facing high costs from excess power capacity and natural gas supply, which are exacerbating the existing revenue gap. An Energy Sector Recovery Program (ESRP), approved in May 2019, provides an action plan to the government to bring the sector back into financial balance over the next five years.

        Through the Land Administration Project, out of a backlog of 62,633 cases of land title applications, 53,479 have been cleared. The number of registered land transactions (deeds and titles) increased from a total of 6,288 in 2011 to a total of 80,109 as of June 2017. As part of decentralizing land administration services to ease congestion, seven Client Services and Access Units have been established, enhancing speedy responses to clients. This has led to significant progress in the reduction of the time it takes to deliver service, thereby reducing the registration of land deeds from three months to two months, and title registration from seven months to four months. An automated Ghana Enterprise Land Information System is being developed to improve efficiency in the provision of land services. A total of 87 Customary Land Secretariats have been established, and are operational under the management of Traditional Authorities, and more than 40,000 land rights issues were recorded by the end of June 2017. Support to the judiciary has also led to six, additional dedicated Land Courts in Accra, three more regional Land Courts in Sekondi, Kumasi and Tamale, and one sub-regional Land Court to serve the port city of Tema.Under the Ghana Commercial Agricultural Project’s Matching Grants Scheme, which provides grants to eligible agribusinesses working with out-growers for land preparation and operating capital, over 6,000 ha of farmland have been developed where crop yields have jumped: rice has gone from a baseline of 1.5 metric tons per ha to 3.8 metric tons per ha in 2017. New irrigation systems and post-harvest warehouses have been built and over 9,300 smallholder farmers (40% women) have been directly supported through nucleus farms to improve their agronomic practices. The project is expected to increase irrigated area by more than 8,000 ha to benefit some 30 medium and large-scale agribusinesses and 14,000 smallholder farmers in target areas. With support from the Secondary Education Improvement Project (SEIP), Ghana has increased the number of seats available to students in senior high schools in underserved districts by at least 37,000 seats and provided over 10,000 scholarships to students in these areas – driving increases in both transition and completion rates, particularly amongst the poorest income quintiles. Education attainment has increased among the poorest 40% in targeted districts from a baseline of 8.4% in 2014 to 13.52% in 2016-17. In 2014 when the SEIP started, the proportion of students from the poorest in deprived districts targeted by the SEIP who accessed secondary education was 8.40%. This proportion has increased to 13.52% in 2017.The transition rate from Junior High School 3(JHS3) to Senior High School 1 in low performing schools in deprived districts has increased from 39% in 2014-15 to 64% in 2017-18. SHS3 completion rates overall have increased from 81.7% in 2014-15 to 84.1% in 2017-18. The proportion of beneficiary schools obtaining 6 credits and above on the WASSCE (secondary school completion exam) has also increased from 10.7% in 2014-15 to 15.27% in 2016-17; among girls the increase was from 9.5% to 14.36%% for the same period.

        The largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia – a diverse archipelago nation of more than 300 ethnic groups – has charted impressive economic growth since overcoming the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.Today, Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous nation, the world’s 10th largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, and a member of the G-20. Furthermore, Indonesia has made enormous gains in poverty reduction, cutting the poverty rate by more than half since 1999, to 9.78% in 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, Indonesia was able to maintain a consistent economic growth, recently qualifying the country to reach the upper middle income status.Indonesia’s economic planning follows a 20-year development plan, spanning from 2005 to 2025. It is segmented into 5-year medium-term plans, called the RPJMN (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional) each with different development priorities. The current medium-term development plan – the last phase of the long-term plan – runs from 2020 to 2024. It aims to further strengthen Indonesia’s economy by improving the country’s human capital and competitiveness in the global market. Considerable challenges remain in achieving Indonesia’s goals. On top of this, the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic brings unprecedented complications for Indonesia to achieve its development goals.  Out of a population of around 270.2 million, about 26.42 million Indonesians still live below the poverty line. Without a significant expansion of social assistance, as many as 5.5-8 million Indonesians could have been pushed into poverty because of the COVID-19 shock.Furthermore, although Indonesia was able to reduce the stunting rate to 27.6% in 2017, more works remains to be done. Such effort is critical to ensure Indonesia’s strong and productive human capital. At the moment, according to the World Bank's Human Capital Index, Indonesia's next generation will only be 54% as productive as she or he could have been with full health and complete education.To immediately respond to the COVID-19 crisis, the Government has announced a fiscal package amounting to 4.3 percent of GDP. The package includes funds to improve the preparedness of the health sector and a substantial increase in social assistance. The World Bank is supporting the Indonesia’s COVID-19 emergency response, including enhancing  social assistance and health care systems while also strengthening the resilience of the financial sector.

        The partnership between Indonesia and the World Bank has evolved over six decades to become one of the Bank’s most significant in terms of lending, knowledge services and implementation support. Since 2004, World Bank support for Indonesia has moved towards supporting a country-led and country-owned policy agenda, consistent with Indonesia’s status as a middle-income country.In December 2015, after broad consultations with government, civil society, and the private sector, the Board approved the 2016-2020 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Indonesia, aligned with the priorities of Indonesia’s medium-term development plan, the RPJMN.The CPF strategy’s main objective was supporting the government of Indonesia to: eliminate extreme poverty, generate prosperity and reduce inequality. The strategy was organized around six engagement areas which were supported by two pillars.Engagement areas:1.   Infrastructure2.   Sustainable and universal energy access3.   Maritime economy and connectivity4.   Delivery of local services5.   Sustainable landscape6.   Collecting more and spending betterSupporting pillar:1.   Leveraging the private sector2.   Shared prosperity, equality and inclusionRelatedly, as part of the country’s engagement approach, Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) for Indonesia has been updated recently. This document provides analytical foundation for the upcoming Country Partnership Framework for the 2020 – 2024 period, which is currently being prepared.

It is segmented into 5-year medium-term plans, called the RPJMN (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional) each with different development priorities. The current medium-term development plan – the last phase of the long-term plan – runs from 2020 to 2024. It aims to further strengthen Indonesia’s economy by improving the country’s human capital and competitiveness in the global market. Considerable challenges remain in achieving Indonesia’s goals. On top of this, the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic brings unprecedented complications for Indonesia to achieve its development goals.  Out of a population of around 270.2 million, about 26.42 million Indonesians still live below the poverty line. Without a significant expansion of social assistance, as many as 5.5-8 million Indonesians could have been pushed into poverty because of the COVID-19 shock.Furthermore, although Indonesia was able to reduce the stunting rate to 27.6% in 2017, more works remains to be done. Such effort is critical to ensure Indonesia’s strong and productive human capital. At the moment, according to the World Bank's Human Capital Index, Indonesia's next generation will only be 54% as productive as she or he could have been with full health and complete education.To immediately respond to the COVID-19 crisis, the Government has announced a fiscal package amounting to 4.3 percent of GDP. The package includes funds to improve the preparedness of the health sector and a substantial increase in social assistance. The World Bank is supporting the Indonesia’s COVID-19 emergency response, including enhancing  social assistance and health care systems while also strengthening the resilience of the financial sector.

        Promoting human capital is an important priority for Indonesia. The National Strategy to Accelerate Stunting Prevention – prepared based on advice from the World Bank, supported by the Investing in Nutrition and Early Years (INEY) Program – has reduced the national stunting rate by a record-breaking 3.1 percentage points in its first year by incentivizing a “whole-of-government” approach to bringing nutrition services to millions of pregnant women and children under two across the country.The World Bank supports the government’s Family Hope Program or Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), which strives to end the cycle of poverty among the poorest. In addition to cash benefit to incentivize beneficiary families in utilizing maternal and children related health and nutrition services and sending their children to schools, the program also provides family development sessions and learning materials to beneficiary mothers so that they can gain a better understanding of health and nutrition, good parenting practices, child protection, and financial management. The program has assisted families to improve their children’s education and health as shown by several impact evaluations. Recent study shows that the cumulative impact of PKH can reduce stunting by around 9 percentage points, which means that the probability of children aged 0 to 60 months being stunted declines by 23%. On the education outcomes, PKH is able to solve the last-mile enrollment problem for children aged 7-15, by eliminating more than half of nonenrolment. Since 2017, the government has expanded the program significantly in both coverage and benefit levels; in 2020, the program reaches 10 million poor and vulnerable families.Promoting human capital is an important priority for Indonesia, and the Bank is helping improve education quality in remote areas. The KIAT Guru pilot empowers communities and ties allowance payment to teachers’ performance. The program has been implemented in over 400 schools. The pilot’s impact evaluation and qualitative study found the pilot significantly improved learning outcomes, parental engagements and teacher efforts compared to non-pilot schools. The Bank is supporting the Ministry of Education and Culture to identify effective mechanism to scale up the pilot to all 55,115 remote schools in Indonesia.The World Bank is also supporting the government’s PAMSIMAS program to provide clean water and sanitation services. Active across 33 provinces and almost 23,000 villages, PAMSIMAS is a collaboration between local governments and communities, and widely considered to be the most cost-effective option for scaling up water and sanitation services. Between 2006 and the end of 2018, 17.2 million have benefited from access to improved water facilities, and 15.4 million people with access to basic and improved sanitation.Transparency plays a crucial role in the administration of good governance. To improve transparency and public participation on state budget spending, with a support from Public Financial Management – Multi Donor Trust Fund, the World Bank has assisted the Ministry of Finance to develop a mobile application that can be accessed by millions of citizens from their smartphones at anytime and anywhere. This mobile application is designed to inform citizens about the central government’s budget and public money being spent for delivering services, including the budget to combat COVID-19 pandemic. After the current final test round, the mobile application is to be launched soon.

        Projects financed by the World Bank Group have achieved important results in Jamaica in recent years. Some highlights include:·       More than 387,000 Jamaicans have benefited from the government’s Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), a conditional cash transfer program that helps improve school attendance and health visits of children in poor households, putting families on a better path, and building the country’s human capital.·       The Rural Economic Development Initiative (REDI) helped to improve market access for micro- and small-scale farmers and their service providers by supporting revenue-generating activities in agriculture and tourism, while also providing critical infrastructure, marketing, and management support. More than 1,400 farmers have benefited from improved technology, training, and access to markets. A Second REDI project signed in March 2020 will scale up investments and will benefit more than 20,000 individual beneficiaries—of which an estimated 40% will be women and 30% youths.·       An education “passport” has been implemented to track the growth and progress of each Jamaican child in their first few years of life, while also setting the quality standards for Early Childhood Development institutions through the Early Childhood Development Project.·       The Jamaica Integrated Community Development Project has helped improve community safety and development in 18 economically and socially vulnerable inner city and rural communities by improving infrastructure such as solar street lighting, water supply systems, solid waste management, the installation of fire hydrants, and introducing violence interrupters and school-based violence prevention. More than 300 young people were trained in entrepreneurship, CPR & first aid, community mediation, and restorative justice.·       The Foundations for Competitiveness and Growth Project helps to strengthen the business environment in Jamaica, facilitate private investment in strategic infrastructure assets and support the transformation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises to high-potential supply chains.·       With the support of the Access to Finance for MSMEs Project, Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Jamaica are better able to access finance. This project also strengthens the Credit Enhancement Facility, a credit guarantee facility and enables the Jamaican business environment to provide more business development services to MSMEs. This project also provides funding for the development of new financing instruments based on movable assets.·       The Jamaica Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project has supported the development of regulations and policies for renewable energy and natural gas, contributing to an increase of generation capacity from 9% at the start of the project, to 12% in 2017, and is expected to reach over 20% in 2030.·       With support from the Strategic Public Sector Transformation Project, formal participatory budgeting has become part of the annual budgeting process in Jamaica since 2015, strengthening the management of public investments. A public investment management system has been put in place to help policymakers provide better governance of public investments.·       The Youth Employment in Digital and Animation Industries Project is building on successful pilots in the Digital Jam and KingstOOn events, with more than 4,000 young Jamaicans engaged in digital enterprises, supporting the growth of the Jamaican animation training and industry.·       As disaster risk management has become a key priority for Jamaica, the Climate Data and Information Management Project is helping improve collection and analysis of climate data while strengthening early warning systems. The Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (DVRP) is helping to enhance physical resilience to disasters. The Bank is supporting Jamaica to elaborate and put in place a comprehensive disaster risk financing architecture.·       IFC supported the BMR Jamaica Wind Project, a 36-megawatt wind farm, which is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 66,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year, equivalent to taking roughly 13,000 cars off the road.·       IFC has worked with several financial institutions to establish SME best practices, improving reach to a financially underserved sector. IFC is in discussions with financial institutions to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19.·       In Agriculture, IFC worked with Jamaican coffee producers to help increase the quality and quantity of coffee grown and processed through a combination of activities focused on improving genetics, sharing best practices in agronomy, and creating inclusive business models. The project facilitated the distribution and planting of over 300,000 coffee seedlings along with technical training to improve productivity. IFC also advised a group of Jamaican producers of sauces and spices on how to strengthen the value chain of SMEs in the sector by enhancing market linkages, using market feedback to address supply-side coordination failures, and improving food safety standards. IFC recently started the Agricultural Supply Chain Linkages project to identify agricultural products that can be produced at a comparative advantage for the Jamaica market.·       IFC is working with the Government of Jamaica on several advisory projects to improve the secured transactions environment, support e-titling with the land agency, build a trade portal with key information on goods exports and imports, and support investment climate reforms. IFC works with Jamaica Promotions Corporation to assist in the implementation reforms in areas measured by investment climate indicators.·      On secured transactions, IFC provided support in the design of a reverse factoring platform to work with anchor firms via the Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ), and support the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in deepening the market for moveable asset-based lending using the collateral registry and secured transactions framework.·      IFC’s technical assistance contributed to the development of a national trade facilitation roadmap and supporting the newly formed Trade Facilitation Task Force. The program supports the simplification and modernization of the complex and inefficient trade regime including developing a trade information portal, building capacity to apply risk management, simplification of procedures and modernization of the Jamaica Customs Act.·  Recently, IFC worked with the Jamaican government to improve the regulatory, institutional, and administrative framework for business taxation in addition to advising on the public-private-partnership concession for the Norman Manley International Airport, which is expected to improve airport access and quality of services for passengers, expand infrastructure capacity, and spur private investment.

        Namibia is a largely desert ranchland with a long coastline on the South Atlantic, bordering South Africa, Botswana, and Angola. The country’s natural mineral riches and a tiny population of about 2.5 million (2019) have made it an upper-middle-income country.  Political stability and sound economic management have helped anchor poverty reduction. However, this has not yet been translated into job creation, and extreme socio-economic inequalities inherited from the years it was run under an apartheid system persist, despite generous public spending on social programs. Economic Outlook Namibia’s economy has continued to face significant headwinds, with real output contracting by a further 1.4% in 2019. Having grown at an average 5.3% between 2010 and 2015, Namibia’s economy entered a recession in 2016 and has since struggled to grow.  COVID-19 (coronavirus) is set to have an unprecedented impact on Namibia’s economy. With trade largely concentrated to a few countries and commodities, travel restrictions and lower demand will result in a contraction in exports. Gross domestic expenditure will also narrow as investment remains muted and the contraction in private consumption—witnessed since the growth slowdown began in 2016—continues. Economic lockdown will also impact tourism, retailers and service sectors, which may result in rising unemployment levels. Taken together, these developments are expected to result in a growth contraction of 4.8% in 2020. The growth outlook is subject to significant uncertainty given the unknown profile of the pandemic and likelihood of further restrictions in activity. Planned investments in mining could create further impetus in the medium term, but significant structural and policy reforms will be required for a broader base growth.  The extreme poverty rate is expected to rise by nearly 2.7 percentage points in 2020, as the pandemic is threatening to widen gaps and increase the already extremely high inequality. The most affected are people living in urban areas, people with secondary education, and those employed in construction, manufacturing, private services, trade or transport sectors. Development Challenges Since its independence in 1990, Namibia has achieved notable progress in reducing poverty, halving the proportion of Namibians living below the national poverty line to 28.7% in 2009-10. In 2015-16, they further reduced that number to 17.4%.  However, in part due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods, poverty rates are projected to increase in the near to medium terms, with the international extreme poverty rate projected to rise to 18.9% in 2022. Typically, female headed households, the less educated, larger families, children and the elderly, and laborers in subsistence farming, are particularly prone to poverty. Severe drought conditions experienced in 2019 constrained agricultural output and led to a sharp decline in harvests. The reduction in precipitation also affected the broader economy through lower electricity and water generation, with repercussions on industrial production. These developments, along with lower diamond and mineral production due to reduced global demand and falling prices, in a context of much-needed fiscal consolidation, have created challenging conditions for growth. Progress toward reducing inequality has been slow and as a result, Namibia is one of the most unequal countries in the world and this slows the pace of poverty reduction. The consumption Gini index declined from 64.6 in 1993/94 to 60.1 in 2004; to 59.5 in 2010, and further to 57.6 in 2015. Namibia’s relatively steady economic growth has, thus, not been enough to deal with the country’s triple challenge of high poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Unemployment has remained stubbornly high at 34.0% of the working population in 2016 from 27.9% in 2014. Unemployment is even higher among women (38.3%) and the youth (43.4%).  A small segment of poor Namibians benefits from employment income, while the majority rely instead on subsistence farming or social grants and other transfers. Slowing economic growth, owing partly to the ongoing fiscal consolidation and slow recovery of the regional trading partners, is expected to further constrain job creation.

        The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY14-17 is the first, full World Bank Group (WBG) country strategy for Namibia, currently extended to 2020 through the Performance and Learning review, an update on the progress of CPS implementation.  The first CPS was developed within the framework of Namibia’s National Development Plan 4 (NDP4) and included carefully calibrated expectations and program objectives that were not overreaching. The advisory, technical assistance and knowledge products envisaged in the CPS are grouped within two focus areas: (i) improving capacity for policy design and implementation in strategic areas; and (ii) increasing the private sector’s ability to generate jobs and income.  The World Bank and the government are currently jointly conducting a diagnostic to identify the binding constraints to the process of poverty reduction which will set a foundation for the successor strategy, the second full WBG framework.

        The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY14–FY17 has delivered on most of the planned advisory activities within its limited program and achieved some important results. Knowledge services and technical assistance were funded mainly by trust funds, such as the Institutional Development Fund, the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, and the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST). Under Pillar 1, delivery of CPS products and results has been strong, including in economic management (debt management, budget transparency, procurement and public-private partnership legal framework), statistical capacity building and poverty analysis. The report on fiscal policy and inequality jointly produced by the Namibia Statistical Agency and the World Bank in FY17 received wide attention from policymakers and the media. Under Pillar 2, the pace of deliveries has been good in the competitive private sector program area (financial sector, investment climate, competition), and substantial progress was made in the infrastructure program, which mainly featured activities of International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.

The reduction in precipitation also affected the broader economy through lower electricity and water generation, with repercussions on industrial production. These developments, along with lower diamond and mineral production due to reduced global demand and falling prices, in a context of much-needed fiscal consolidation, have created challenging conditions for growth. Progress toward reducing inequality has been slow and as a result, Namibia is one of the most unequal countries in the world and this slows the pace of poverty reduction. The consumption Gini index declined from 64.6 in 1993/94 to 60.1 in 2004; to 59.5 in 2010, and further to 57.6 in 2015. Namibia’s relatively steady economic growth has, thus, not been enough to deal with the country’s triple challenge of high poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Unemployment has remained stubbornly high at 34.0% of the working population in 2016 from 27.9% in 2014. Unemployment is even higher among women (38.3%) and the youth (43.4%).  A small segment of poor Namibians benefits from employment income, while the majority rely instead on subsistence farming or social grants and other transfers. Slowing economic growth, owing partly to the ongoing fiscal consolidation and slow recovery of the regional trading partners, is expected to further constrain job creation.

        AT A GLANCEIn 2018, the World Bank came up with its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) covering the five-year period of FY2019-2023. Coincidentally, this came at a time of historic transformation in Nepal, as a new government took up office in February 2018. The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006 ended a 10-year conflict that came at a significant cost of lives and foregone economic development. Since then, Nepal has gone through lengthy and complex transitions towards a new Constitution in 2015 that set in place a federal structure.  By the end of 2017, elections were successfully held at the federal, state, and local tiers. There is a newfound optimism for greater political stability, inclusion, good governance and sustainable growth. The new federal structure presents unprecedented opportunities for Nepal to reset its development storyline, as outlined in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).  At the same time, the shift to federalism poses new challenges and source of fragility, given the heightened popular aspirations and expectations. Key challenges include the need to clarify the functions and accountabilities of the federal, state, and local governments; deliver basic services and maintain infrastructure development; create a conducive environment for the private sector; and address governance weaknesses that may worsen in the early years of the new federal system.COUNTRY CONTEXTA new government, backed by a historic majority in Parliament, completed a year of office on February 15, 2019. The government was  preceded by elections for all three tiers (local, state and federal) of the state architecture defined by the new constitution, marking a protracted but successful conclusion of a political transition that began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in November 2006. State governments largely mirror the coalition at the center. At the sub-national level, funds, functions and functionaries hitherto managed by the central, district and village authorities are moving to the seven new states and 753 local governments for which new legislation, institutions and administrative procedures are being formalized as constitutionally prescribed.  Meanwhile, the central level authority is being streamlined with a focus on oversight.  These exercises at state restructuring are expected to result in improved outreach and service delivery but will likely take time before they become fully operational. Significant adjustments need to be made to the government structure.  They include amending over 400 existing acts, restructuring the civil service at all levels, devolving fiscal management, and determining the division of funds, functions, and functionaries between various levels of government.In contrast to the frequent changes in government that characterized Nepal’s decade-long transition to federalism, the new government enjoys a historic super-majority in Parliament.  Along with new constitutional checks and a far fewer number of political parties, there is a much greater degree of optimism for stability in the coming days.  However, state restructuring on this scale is uncharted territory for Nepal and smoothening the transition from the previous unitary system to the new federal one will remain a daunting task. The new system, in principle, provides opportunities to decentralize development benefits and make service delivery more effective and accountable.  However, the risks of jurisdictional overlap between the three tiers of government, lack of clarity and coherence between policies and devolved powers, and duplication of efforts will remain high during the coming few years.  Key aspects of the new system require further definition and may continue to be contested by different population groups.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSEconomic growth slowed to 0.2 percent in FY20, mainly due to a national lockdown in response to the pandemic. Service sector growth deteriorated to an 18-year low of 0.7 percent, as tourism arrivals stopped and domestic transport and wholesale and retail trade were disrupted. Industrial growth contracted, and capacity utilization fell from 80 to 46 percent because of shortages in production inputs and labor. Agricultural growth also decelerated sharply as market access and labor mobility became constrained. On the expenditure side, a contraction in private consumption and investment was marginally offset by positive contributions from government expenditures (on wages and COVID-19 related expenditures on health and social assistance) and net exports (driven by lower imports).Average inflation reached 6.2 percent in FY20. Food price inflation spiked in early FY20 following an export ban on onions by India and remained elevated because of localized food shortages resulting from transport disruptions. Prudential indicators of banking and financial institutions remained within regulatory targets: non-performing loans stood at 1.9 percent, capital adequacy at 14.2 percent, and liquidity at 27.9 percent. As a part of COVID-19 relief measures, the central bank relaxed regulatory requirements for banking and financial institutions, reduced the targeted interest rate, and increased the size of the refinancing facility. Despite these measures, deposit growth exceeded credit growth for the first time in five years: the credit to core capital and deposits ratio fell to 69.6 percent, well below the 80 percent regulatory limit.Trade disruptions led to a 19.7 percent year-on-year drop in imports in FY20, significantly narrowing the current account deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP. The sharp drop in imports outweighed both the contraction in exports - reflecting lower external demand for Nepali goods and a shutdown of tourist arrivals – and a 3.4 percent decline in remittance inflows due to lower outmigration and weak economic activity in migrant receiving countries. The current account deficit was mostly financed by external concessional loans. Foreign exchange reserves increased to $11.6 billion, equivalent to 12.7 months of imports.The fiscal deficit increased in FY20 as trade restrictions caused a 5 percent contraction in tax revenue. The fall in tax revenue was partly offset by low budget execution, with total expenditures remaining close to FY19 levels in nominal terms. As a result, the fiscal deficit widened only marginally, to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY20. Public debt increased to 38.3 percent of GDP in FY20, compared to 30.1 percent in FY19, reflecting the adverse growth dynamics.COVID-19 related disruptions in livelihoods and the contraction in households’ consumption are expected to have affected the poor, vulnerable, and households engaged in informal sector activities disproportionately. Therefore, poverty is likely to increase in 2020. However, outdated poverty data (from 2010/11) makes projection-based estimates of poverty imprecise. The 2017/18 national labor market data also predates COVID-19. But, new data from an ongoing regional survey on the labor impacts of COVID- 19 will help track the evolution of job losses and recoveries in the last quarter of 2020.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to $11.6 billion, equivalent to 12.7 months of imports.The fiscal deficit increased in FY20 as trade restrictions caused a 5 percent contraction in tax revenue. The fall in tax revenue was partly offset by low budget execution, with total expenditures remaining close to FY19 levels in nominal terms. As a result, the fiscal deficit widened only marginally, to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY20. Public debt increased to 38.3 percent of GDP in FY20, compared to 30.1 percent in FY19, reflecting the adverse growth dynamics.COVID-19 related disruptions in livelihoods and the contraction in households’ consumption are expected to have affected the poor, vulnerable, and households engaged in informal sector activities disproportionately. Therefore, poverty is likely to increase in 2020. However, outdated poverty data (from 2010/11) makes projection-based estimates of poverty imprecise. The 2017/18 national labor market data also predates COVID-19. But, new data from an ongoing regional survey on the labor impacts of COVID- 19 will help track the evolution of job losses and recoveries in the last quarter of 2020.

        AT A GLANCEIn 2018, the World Bank came up with its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) covering the five-year period of FY2019-2023. Coincidentally, this came at a time of historic transformation in Nepal, as a new government took up office in February 2018. The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006 ended a 10-year conflict that came at a significant cost of lives and foregone economic development. Since then, Nepal has gone through lengthy and complex transitions towards a new Constitution in 2015 that set in place a federal structure.  By the end of 2017, elections were successfully held at the federal, state, and local tiers. There is a newfound optimism for greater political stability, inclusion, good governance and sustainable growth. The new federal structure presents unprecedented opportunities for Nepal to reset its development storyline, as outlined in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).  At the same time, the shift to federalism poses new challenges and source of fragility, given the heightened popular aspirations and expectations. Key challenges include the need to clarify the functions and accountabilities of the federal, state, and local governments; deliver basic services and maintain infrastructure development; create a conducive environment for the private sector; and address governance weaknesses that may worsen in the early years of the new federal system.COUNTRY CONTEXTA new government, backed by a historic majority in Parliament, completed a year of office on February 15, 2019. The government was  preceded by elections for all three tiers (local, state and federal) of the state architecture defined by the new constitution, marking a protracted but successful conclusion of a political transition that began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in November 2006. State governments largely mirror the coalition at the center. At the sub-national level, funds, functions and functionaries hitherto managed by the central, district and village authorities are moving to the seven new states and 753 local governments for which new legislation, institutions and administrative procedures are being formalized as constitutionally prescribed.  Meanwhile, the central level authority is being streamlined with a focus on oversight.  These exercises at state restructuring are expected to result in improved outreach and service delivery but will likely take time before they become fully operational. Significant adjustments need to be made to the government structure.  They include amending over 400 existing acts, restructuring the civil service at all levels, devolving fiscal management, and determining the division of funds, functions, and functionaries between various levels of government.In contrast to the frequent changes in government that characterized Nepal’s decade-long transition to federalism, the new government enjoys a historic super-majority in Parliament.  Along with new constitutional checks and a far fewer number of political parties, there is a much greater degree of optimism for stability in the coming days.  However, state restructuring on this scale is uncharted territory for Nepal and smoothening the transition from the previous unitary system to the new federal one will remain a daunting task. The new system, in principle, provides opportunities to decentralize development benefits and make service delivery more effective and accountable.  However, the risks of jurisdictional overlap between the three tiers of government, lack of clarity and coherence between policies and devolved powers, and duplication of efforts will remain high during the coming few years.  Key aspects of the new system require further definition and may continue to be contested by different population groups.RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSEconomic growth slowed to 0.2 percent in FY20, mainly due to a national lockdown in response to the pandemic. Service sector growth deteriorated to an 18-year low of 0.7 percent, as tourism arrivals stopped and domestic transport and wholesale and retail trade were disrupted. Industrial growth contracted, and capacity utilization fell from 80 to 46 percent because of shortages in production inputs and labor. Agricultural growth also decelerated sharply as market access and labor mobility became constrained. On the expenditure side, a contraction in private consumption and investment was marginally offset by positive contributions from government expenditures (on wages and COVID-19 related expenditures on health and social assistance) and net exports (driven by lower imports).Average inflation reached 6.2 percent in FY20. Food price inflation spiked in early FY20 following an export ban on onions by India and remained elevated because of localized food shortages resulting from transport disruptions. Prudential indicators of banking and financial institutions remained within regulatory targets: non-performing loans stood at 1.9 percent, capital adequacy at 14.2 percent, and liquidity at 27.9 percent. As a part of COVID-19 relief measures, the central bank relaxed regulatory requirements for banking and financial institutions, reduced the targeted interest rate, and increased the size of the refinancing facility. Despite these measures, deposit growth exceeded credit growth for the first time in five years: the credit to core capital and deposits ratio fell to 69.6 percent, well below the 80 percent regulatory limit.Trade disruptions led to a 19.7 percent year-on-year drop in imports in FY20, significantly narrowing the current account deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP. The sharp drop in imports outweighed both the contraction in exports - reflecting lower external demand for Nepali goods and a shutdown of tourist arrivals – and a 3.4 percent decline in remittance inflows due to lower outmigration and weak economic activity in migrant receiving countries.

        THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND NEPALThe World Bank Group (WBG) fielded its first economic mission to Nepal in 1963 to assess the country’s development prospects and challenges. It approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project.After three consecutive Interim Strategies in FY 2007, 2009 and 2011, the WBG provided longer-term support through the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY2014-2018. The CPS aimed to support Nepal’s aspirations for higher and more inclusive economic growth to help equalize opportunities across population groups.Nepal is eligible for concessional financing support from the International Development Association (IDA). During the IDA17 period (17th replenishment of IDA covering FY2015-2017), the World Bank committed $1.2 billion. This amount included additional financing of $300 million from the IDA Crisis Response Window to respond to the emergency needs after the 2015 earthquake. During IDA18 period (FY2018-2020), Nepal may access approximately $1.3 billion in IDA financing. This includes additional financing from the IDA Exceptional Risk Mitigation Regime financing window.In 2018, the World Bank Group operationalized its Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Nepal, that covers a period of five years – FY2019 to FY2023. The overarching goal is to support Nepal’s new federal system that can deliver on higher sustained growth for poverty reduction, inclusive development, and shared prosperity. The new federal structure introduced by the 2015 Constitution presents unprecedented opportunities to reset Nepal’s development trajectory. There is a newfound optimism for greater political stability, inclusion, good governance and sustainable growth following the elections in 2017 and the establishment of a new government in early 2018.The CPF prioritizes the following areas:Strengthening public institutions.  The WBG will be explicit in its support to strengthening public institutions for effective economic management, service delivery, and public investment not only at national level, but at sub-national levels.    Private sector led jobs and growth.  The WBG will contribute to generating more and better jobs through private sector-driven growth, building on ongoing work to improve access to energy and connectivity, regulatory environment and financial sector stability. Inclusion and diversity.  The WBG will work to achieve greater inclusion for the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized groups, with greater resilience against climate change, natural disasters, and other exogenous shocks.  Across all its activities, the World Bank will aim to achieve greater gender equity and inclusion, to ensure citizen engagement, to incorporate climate co-benefits, and to maximize financing for development.WORLD BANK PROGRAMIn Nepal, the World Bank Group (WBG) includes the International Development Association (IDA), the concessionary lending arm; the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm; and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the investment risk insurance arm.The World Bank currently supports 25 active investment projects in Nepal with $2.4 billion in commitments from IDA and trust funds of which a significant portion is for policy reforms in the areas of fiscal decentralization, the financial sector, and the energy sector. The indicative resources available under IDA18 (FY2018-2020) are about $1.39 billion, including $300 million from the IDA Risk Mitigation Regime. IFC aims to commit about $800 million to $1.2 billion over the five-year period (FY19 to FY23). MIGA is actively seeking opportunities to support foreign private investment into Nepal.In addition to financing investment projects, the World Bank is supporting the government’s policy reforms in fiscal management and the financial sector. For example, through development policy financing it has supported the restructuring of the banking sector, strengthening the sector’s legal and regulatory framework and improving transparency in the financial sector. The World Bank is also financing the government’s programs for healthcare reforms and education development.The World Bank has provided a range of analytical and advisory support for policy reforms and economic and sector advice. One recent flagship report was “Climbing Higher: Toward a Middle-Income Nepal” that offered policy recommendations for escaping the low-growth trap. Together with UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) it also published “Moving Up the Ladder – Poverty Reduction in Social Mobility in Nepal.” Other World Bank analysis included reports on health insurance, education, nutrition and urban engagement.  Twice a year, the World Bank issues the Nepal Development Update that reviews the state of Nepal’s economy.After the 2015 earthquake, the WBG responded quickly and flexibly to finance emergency reconstruction, coordinating closely with other development partners. The World Bank restructured, reallocated or extended 12 existing IDA projects for recovery efforts. In parallel with the Japan International Cooperation Agency, it funded the Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Project ($200 million).  The World Bank also administered a multi-donor trust fund ($10 million) that pooled resources from Canada, DFID, Switzerland, and USAID.WORLD BANK – IFC COLLABORATIONThe World Bank is working closely with the IFC to strengthen the environment for private sector investment and promote private sector growth. Nepal is one of the pilot countries for the WBG’s renewed efforts to maximize financing for development by crowding in private sector finance and to minimize public debt and contingent liabilities. The two institutions coordinate closely in the energy and financial sectors. In addition to the SCD, multiple joint analytical work is underway, including the Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD) and the Infrastructure Sector Assessment Program (InfraSAP).IFC Nepal focuses on private sector development through provision of financing and advisory services to companies to boost their competitiveness, while expanding financial inclusion and delivering sustainable infrastructure solutions. IFC’s current portfolio in Nepal is $57 million. The budget for advisory support aimed at creating bankable projects and building capacity stands at nearly $16 million.IFC’s strategy focuses on addressing development gaps in financial inclusion, sustainable infrastructure, and competitiveness. IFC is supporting financial institutions and venture funds to expand access to finance for SMEs and individuals. With the World Bank, it has helped unlock barriers for new infrastructure projects, including the ground-breaking 216 MW Upper Trishuli-1 hydropower project that is expected to attract the largest single project foreign direct investment into Nepal.Through its advisory services, IFC is working with the Government and the private sector on improving Nepal’s investment climate, enhancing regional connectivity and promoting investment in tourism.MIGAMIGA has coordinated with the World Bank and IFC to consider a guarantee support for the Upper Trishuli-1 Hydro Project. The Agency is ready to consider further projects across sectors as appropriate opportunities emerge.

        RECENT UPDATEAs of March 21, 2019, 723,120 beneficiaries have been identified in 14 most affected districts. Out of this, around 90 percent of beneficiaries have signed the Grant Participation Agreement, almost all of whom have received the first tranche of payment. 522,934 beneficiaries have received the second tranche payment, while 396,441 have received the third tranche.Out of the beneficiaries, 361,153 are currently reconstructing their homes, receiving technical and monitoring support from the Nepal Reconstruction Authority (NRA). World Bank is facilitating this process of reconstruction by sending out bulk SMSes to the beneficiaries, advising them of the various processes and requirements of reconstruction. Similarly, the NRA has set up a toll-free 24-hour hotline to cater to the queries of beneficiaries regarding reconstruction. NRA is also collaborating with a few agencies to disseminate Public Service Announcements to ensure that beneficiaries acquire correct and timely information on the reconstruction and monitoring procedure.  BACKGROUNDOn April 25, 2015, a major earthquake occurred at shallow depth with a magnitude of 7.8 in central Nepal causing widespread destruction. There were several aftershocks as well as a subsequent earthquake event of magnitude 7.3 on May 12. A combined 9,000 lives were lost and close to ten million people in at least 31 of 75 districts were affected, making this the worst disaster in Nepal’s history in terms of human casualties. An assessment of the impact shows that Nepal’s recovery needs amount to the equivalent of a third of its economy. The Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) priced the damage at US$ 7 billion, with total reconstruction needs at $6.7 billion. The largest single need identified by the PDNA was housing and human settlements, estimated at about $3.27 billion.Economic impact of the earthquakeEarly estimates suggested that an additional 3 percent of the population had been pushed into poverty as a direct result of the earthquakes. This translates into as many as a million more poor people. The earthquake, coupled with trade disruptions that occurred from September 2015-January 2016, pushed down the overall growth of FY 2016 to 0.6 percent (at market prices) – the lowest in 14 years.Reflecting both the earthquake and trade related disruptions, inflation spiked to over 12 percent (y/y) by mid-January rising 5 percentage points in just four months from mid-September 2015. This was the highest inflation level since FY 2009. As the trade disruptions ended, inflation eased to back to single digits. Economic activity in Nepal, which rebounded strongly in FY2017, reaching 7.5 percent (y/y) following two challenging years, has again been impacted by severe flood affecting more than one-third of the country, as indicated in the latest Nepal Development Update (October 2017).Support from international donorsAfter the earthquakes, the international community rallied to provide immediate rescue and relief and support for the country’s longer-term recovery. An International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction was held in Kathmandu on June 25, 2015. Numerous countries, international financial institutions, foundations, and NGOs stepped forward, pledging about $4.4 billion to support Nepal’s recovery and reconstruction and help the country become more resilient to future events.The government swung into action, launching the Post-Disaster Recovery Framework on May 12, 2016. It outlines all sector plans and financial projects through 2020. In December of 2015, it also established the Nepal Reconstruction Authority (NRA) and appointed a Chief Executive Officer to expedite the reconstruction process.The government also established the Nepal Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) to support housing reconstruction. The fund is administered by the World Bank. Current committed financing includes: (i) $200 million from IDA’s Crisis Response Window; (ii) $100 million credit from JICA for parallel financing; (iii) $30.56 million in a World Bank-administered Multi-Donor Trust Fund (USAID – $9.6 million, Switzerland - Swiss Francs 7 million, Canada – CAN$ 10 million and United Kingdom, DfID – GBP 4.8 million). Out of $30.56 million committed under MDTF, $26.59 million has been received; (iv) about $200 million earmarked by I/NGOs for the sector; and (v) $50 million from the World Bank’s budget support.

        World Bank GovernorMinister of International Development Dag-Inge Ulstein represents Norway on the World Bank Board of Governors, the Bank’s senior decision-making body. The Governors, usually Ministers of Finance or Development, meet twice a year. The Governors have the power to admit and suspend members of the World Bank Group, increase or decrease the authorized capital stock, determine the distribution of the net income of the Bank, and decide on the World Bank Group’s overall strategic direction. Norway’s Alternate Governor is State Secretary Aksel Jakobsen.World Bank Executive DirectorThe Governor Delegates responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day business of Norway’s interests at the Bank to the Executive Director (ED) representing Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. EDs reside in Washington and normally meet twice a week to decide on borrowing and financial questions, projects, and policies that affect World Bank Group general operations. Geir Haarde (Iceland) is the ED representing the Nordic-Baltic constituency on the 25-member World Bank Board of Executive Directors, and Joergen Frotzler (Sweden) is the Alternate Executive Director.Shares and Voting PowerThe World Bank Group has a weighted system of voting. All members of the Bank receive votes consisting of share votes (one vote for each share of the Bank's capital stock held by the member) plus basic votes (calculated so that the sum of all basic votes is equal to 5.55% of the sum of basic votes and share votes for all members). The voting power distribution differs from agency to agency within the World Bank Group.For the latest voting status, please visit the Voting Powers page.For information on Norway’s aid flows as a donor, please visit the Aid Flows Norway page.

        The COVID-19 pandemic hit Paraguay just as the country was embarking on a strong recovery path after growth had stalled in 2019. The global recession is likely to lead to a GDP decline of 1.2 percent in 2020. Thereafter, growth is expected to return to 4 percent, as the world economy recovers.  This is subject to the downside risk of a slower than expected normalization of global markets. In turn, poverty is expected to increase in 2020, and income inequality to remain high.The COVID-19 outbreak hits the Paraguay economy in a moment of economic recovery after growth had stalled in 2019. The economy was in a recession in the first half of 2019 (-3 percent year-on-year) due to weak performance of the main trading partners, especially Argentina, and adverse climatic conditions, but started to recover in the second half of the year (+3 percent year-on-year) as agriculture output rebounded along with favorable weather. Similarly, in the labor market, after the combined unemployment and underemployment rate reached 14.5 percent in the first half of 2019, it retracted to 12.9 percent in the second half of the year.With a weaker economy and inflation close to the lower band of the target range (4 +/- 2 percent), the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) moved to a more accommodative stance, consistent with the inflation objective. During 2019, the BCP lowered the policy rate by a cumulative 125 bps to 4 percent. In February 2020, the inflation rate was 2.4 percent year-on-year. The flexible exchange rate regime continued to cushion external shocks. Meanwhile, foreign currency reserves remained at prudent levels, recovering after an initial decline at the onset of the Argentina crisis in 2018.Given the recession in the first half of 2019, the authorities invoked the escape clause from the fiscal rule, capping the budget deficit (the Fiscal Responsibility Law, FRL, allows an increase of the deficit ceiling from 1.5 percent of GDP up to 3 percent GDP in times of crises). Therefore, the central government’s budget was executed with a deficit of 2.9 percent GDP in 2019. While current expenditure grew by 8.2 percent, capital expenditure increased by 28.9 percent, although from a low base. The Parliament approved the 2020 Budget Law with a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, coherent with the FRL. With the economic slowdown, poverty reduction continued, but at a slower pace: poverty rate fell from 24.2 percent in 2018 to 23.5 percent in 2019.  There remain 1.6 million people below the official poverty line.  Poverty reduction almost halted in urban areas (17.8 percent in 2018 compared to 17.5 percent in 2019) due to a decrease in labor incomes in commerce and manufacturing. Rural poverty dropped from 34.6 percent in 2018 to 33.4 percent, despite stable labor incomes in agriculture, which concentrates almost half (0.6 million) of mostly informal rural workers.  While an improvement on income inequality was recorded, the Gini index remains high 46.1.Against this backdrop and the ongoing Dengue outbreak, the authorities have reacted swiftly to the outbreak of the COVID-19 in March 2020 to mitigate the impact on the economy and people. The Government implemented social distancing measures and population movement controls. The BCP reduced the policy interest rate by 175 bps to 2.25 percent, and temporarily relaxed provisioning rules not to penalize credit restructurings and prolongations. An anti-crisis fiscal package approved by Parliament includes additional spending on health and social protection programs, a subsidy for informal workers, support to small businesses, reallocation from non-priority spending lines, and a moratorium on fines for delayed tax payments. To finance it, the Government received authorization for an increase of the borrowing limit by US$ 1.6 billion and suspension of the FRL for up to four years.Economic dynamics in 2020 is expected to be severely affected by the global recession accentuated by the reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. After the strong first quarter of 2020 due to “normalization” of agricultural harvest (as indicated by the high-frequency data for Jan-Feb), the economy will likely strongly contract in the next two quarters. The downturn will be driven by the decline in external demand and in domestic demand, especially in services, as a result of social distancing measures to slow the expansion of the pandemic. The economic package of the authorities, which is expected to increase fiscal deficit to 4 percent GDP, will soften the impact but would not fully compensate for it. In 2021-22, growth is expected to return to 4 percent, as the global economy recovers, and helped by consistent macroeconomic policies, anchored in the inflation targeting and a gradual return towards the FRL ceilings. Inflation is projected to return to the mid-point of the target range (4 percent) in 2021.Going forward, poverty reduction is expected to stall, implying the need for a higher social protection support in the face of the expected global recession.  Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment and underemployment are expected to increase in commerce, services and construction. Labor incomes are expected to drop, especially for workers in the informal sector in the urban areas. The performance of family-based agriculture will be crucial for the protection of the most vulnerable in the rural areas. In addition, stronger labor income growth is needed in the services sector to improve livelihoods of those at the bottom of the income distribution in urban areas to attenuate the effects of the pandemic.Paraguay has a solid macroeconomic framework based on fiscal rules, inflation targeting, and a flexible exchange rate regime. With the track-record of prudent macroeconomic policy over the last decade, low public debt and adequate FX reserves, the macroeconomic policies and crisis response measures are expected to be effective in absorbing a part of the COVID-19 shock. However, Paraguay is vulnerable to the domestic economic slowdown resulting from measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and its effects (social distancing, fiscal responses), as well as a steep reduction in economic activity in the global economy, and in neighboring countries. This will compound other, “pre-existing” economic risks and could disproportionally affect labor incomes of the 65 percent of informal workers in commerce and services. While the banking sector of Paraguay has a minimal exposure to Argentina, the real sector linkages through exports and remittances are stronger. Moreover, the concentration of exports in a few agricultural products continues to render growth and poverty vulnerable to fluctuations in agriculture commodity markets and to weather-related shocks (as showcased in 2019), affecting especially the most vulnerable population.

Rural poverty dropped from 34.6 percent in 2018 to 33.4 percent, despite stable labor incomes in agriculture, which concentrates almost half (0.6 million) of mostly informal rural workers.  While an improvement on income inequality was recorded, the Gini index remains high 46.1.Against this backdrop and the ongoing Dengue outbreak, the authorities have reacted swiftly to the outbreak of the COVID-19 in March 2020 to mitigate the impact on the economy and people. The Government implemented social distancing measures and population movement controls.

While the banking sector of Paraguay has a minimal exposure to Argentina, the real sector linkages through exports and remittances are stronger. Moreover, the concentration of exports in a few agricultural products continues to render growth and poverty vulnerable to fluctuations in agriculture commodity markets and to weather-related shocks (as showcased in 2019), affecting especially the most vulnerable population.

        The COVID-19 pandemic hit Paraguay just as the country was embarking on a strong recovery path after growth had stalled in 2019. The global recession is likely to lead to a GDP decline of 1.2 percent in 2020. Thereafter, growth is expected to return to 4 percent, as the world economy recovers.  This is subject to the downside risk of a slower than expected normalization of global markets. In turn, poverty is expected to increase in 2020, and income inequality to remain high.The COVID-19 outbreak hits the Paraguay economy in a moment of economic recovery after growth had stalled in 2019. The economy was in a recession in the first half of 2019 (-3 percent year-on-year) due to weak performance of the main trading partners, especially Argentina, and adverse climatic conditions, but started to recover in the second half of the year (+3 percent year-on-year) as agriculture output rebounded along with favorable weather. Similarly, in the labor market, after the combined unemployment and underemployment rate reached 14.5 percent in the first half of 2019, it retracted to 12.9 percent in the second half of the year.With a weaker economy and inflation close to the lower band of the target range (4 +/- 2 percent), the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) moved to a more accommodative stance, consistent with the inflation objective. During 2019, the BCP lowered the policy rate by a cumulative 125 bps to 4 percent. In February 2020, the inflation rate was 2.4 percent year-on-year. The flexible exchange rate regime continued to cushion external shocks. Meanwhile, foreign currency reserves remained at prudent levels, recovering after an initial decline at the onset of the Argentina crisis in 2018.Given the recession in the first half of 2019, the authorities invoked the escape clause from the fiscal rule, capping the budget deficit (the Fiscal Responsibility Law, FRL, allows an increase of the deficit ceiling from 1.5 percent of GDP up to 3 percent GDP in times of crises). Therefore, the central government’s budget was executed with a deficit of 2.9 percent GDP in 2019. While current expenditure grew by 8.2 percent, capital expenditure increased by 28.9 percent, although from a low base. The Parliament approved the 2020 Budget Law with a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, coherent with the FRL. With the economic slowdown, poverty reduction continued, but at a slower pace: poverty rate fell from 24.2 percent in 2018 to 23.5 percent in 2019.  There remain 1.6 million people below the official poverty line.  Poverty reduction almost halted in urban areas (17.8 percent in 2018 compared to 17.5 percent in 2019) due to a decrease in labor incomes in commerce and manufacturing.

        The World Bank Group (WBG) Board of Executive Directors endorsed the new Country Partnership Framework for Paraguay, establishing the lending and technical assistance program for 2019-2023. The strategy supports the country’s efforts to promote sustainable growth and institutional strengthening, while supporting investments in human capital, and advancing the fight against corruption.The CPF is built around three focus areas:promoting accountable institutions and an improved business climate;natural capital management and integration into sustainable value chains; building human capital. In addition, recognizing that socio-economic progress is highly contingent on strengthening the social contract between the Government and the population, the CPF will also encompass a cross-cutting emphasis on transparency, results-orientation and accountability.

        World Bank (IBRD) financing helped to achieve the following results:Improved the agricultural productivityThe Sustainable Agriculture & Rural Development Project (PRODERS), the main Government tool to fight rural poverty, has reached overall 240,000 beneficiaries corresponding to 48,251 households, who benefited from agricultural services, particularly technical assistance. A random sample of 1,029 households comprising beneficiaries from 2011 to 2016 who benefited from the estrategia campesina (strategy for farmers) recently took place and concluded that 24,875 poor households in Eastern Paraguay are expected to report an increase in real agriculture incomes by 2018. At the local level, the Project has also built significant capacity and commitment in more than 600 rural communities to plan and execute local development interventions. As a result, 180 indigenous communities prepared and are implementing socio-economic development plans by 2018, highly surpassing the target of 130 communities.Improved access to quality water and sanitation servicesThe Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project has contributed to the rehabilitation of 57 km of water distribution networks and 8.4 km of sanitation networks in Great Asuncion. About 270,000 people, 10% of the population in the capital Asuncion have access to improved sanitation environment. The project has contributed to improve rural water and sanitation infrastructure, already benefiting 6,190 indigenous individuals, half of whom are women. In addition, the project has also supported the decentralization of the National Environmental Sanitation Services (SENASA), as well as the development of an action plan to support the Water and Sanitation Units of the municipalities in Chaco to ensure long-term technical, institutional and financial support to all indigenous communities.Improved road infrastructure in target areas, particularly benefiting the rural populationThe Road Maintenance Project expanded rural connectivity and helped strengthen government capacity to define investment priorities and develop efficient work programs aligned with existing budgets. Institutional improvements have also been supported by legal actions in five key areas: passage of a transit and road safety law; passage of law to amend the classification of road system; creation of a planning department in Minister of Public Works (MOPC); increase in toll rates to cover costs of the system; and creation of a department for transparency and public participation. The Project financed  improvements to about 141 km of unpaved roads and many bridges in the three targeted departments and contributed to the introduction of performance-based contracts, with three contracts implemented for a total of 624 km.Increased efficiency of the transmission networkThe energy supply through the transmission network has increased by 65 percent, from 3,000,008 KwH to 4,949,000 KwH. This increased efficiency has benefited 2.5 million people in the Asuncion Metropolitan Area, of whom approximately 15 percent are below the national poverty line. The project was successful in modernizing ANDE’s communication system (Sistema de Gestión Integral de Distribución Eléctrica (SGIDE)), which improved the quality of the access by reducing service cuts and repair times.

        Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country with a GDP per capita of USD 3,852 (2019) and a total population of 21.8 million. Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, the economy grew at an average 5.3 percent during the period 2010-2019, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards reconstruction and growth; although growth slowed down in the last few years.The economy is transitioning from a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing and services. Social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries. Economic growth has translated into shared prosperity with the national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1 percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical pockets; however, a relatively large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the poverty line.Low fiscal revenues combined with largely non-discretionary expenditure in salary bill, transfers, and interest payments have constrained critical development spending on health, education and social protection, which is low compared to peer countries. Public debt levels are high while the overall debt portfolio indicate some important challenges.Recent developmentsAfter growing by 2.3 percent in 2019, the economy contracted by 1.6 percent y-o-y in the first quarter of 2020. The contraction, a first in 19 years, was driven by weak performances of construction, textile, mining and tea industries. Against this backdrop, the COVID-19 health crisis is believed to have impacted economic activity severely since the first quarter. High frequency indicators suggest that growth has faltered in the second quarter, as curfews impeded economic activity and global demand remained weak. Moreover, the closure of airports to tourists between April and September brought tourism activity to a standstill.Weak demand has kept inflation in check thus far in 2020, creating room for policy support. Annual average inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index was 4.1 percent in August 2020 despite high food inflation. This allowed the Central Bank to reduce policy rates by 250 basis points and the reserve ratio by 300 basis points over the first seven months of 2020. The Central Bank also introduced a refinancing facility and a credit guarantee scheme to encourage commercial banks to increase lending. Despite these measures, private credit growth remained subdued in the first half of 2020. Asset quality and earnings of the financial businesses deteriorated, reflecting the impact of decelerating loan recoveries and shrinking margins.The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed in the first half of 2020. A reduction in imports due to severe import restrictions is likely to have offset reduced receipts from remittances, tourism, tea and textiles. Following heavy depreciation pressures in March, the LKR stabilized in the second quarter, as import controls helped the current account. Official reserves, estimated at USD 7.4 billion as of August, remain low relative to short-term external liabilities. Included in reserves is a swap facility of USD 400 million with the Reserve Bank of India and a loan of USD 500 million from the China Development Bank. The Central Bank also secured a repo facility with the New York Federal Reserve Bank for USD 1.0 billion as a contingency measure. A Eurobond of USD 1.0 billion is maturing in October 2020.Fiscal accounts deteriorated in the first four months of 2020. Tax revenues fell short due to weak collection of value-added, income, and import taxes. The fiscal stimulus package implemented in November 2019 -which included a reduction of the VAT rate and an increase of the registration threshold, as well as import controls-, and slow growth contributed to the reduction in tax collection during this period. As a result, despite a moderation in public investment, the overall budget deficit increased by 24 percent in the first four months of 2020, year-on-year. Approximately half of the deficit was financed by Central Bank credit. The central government debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 90 percent (from 86.9 percent at end 2019), with more than half of the debt denominated in foreign currency. Citing limited fiscal buffers and external vulnerabilities, Fitch and S&P downgraded the sovereign rating to B-.The economic effects of COVID-19 will have significant welfare implications. Poverty measured using the $3.20 poverty line (in 2011 PPP) is estimated to have declined from 9.4 percent in 2018 to 8.9 percent in 2019. However, the COVID-19 crisis is believed to have triggered sharp jobs and earnings losses. Informal workers, about 70 percent of the workforce, are particularly vulnerable as they lack employment protection or paid leave. The apparel industry, which employs about half a million workers, has reportedly cut significant jobs. While agricultural production is expected to be largely undisrupted, weak external demand likely impacted export-oriented subsectors and wages. High food price inflation, which remains at double-digits, is disproportionately affecting the poor who spend a larger share of their budget on food.

        OutlookThe COVID-19 crisis has substantially clouded the outlook and exacerbated an already challenging macroeconomic situation. The economy is expected to contract by 6.7 percent in 2020, with all key drivers of demand affected: exports, private consumption and investment. The current account deficit is expected to remain low (at 2.2 percent of GDP in 2020) thanks to low oil prices and strict import restrictions, which should largely offset the reduction in receipts from garment exports, tourism and remittances. However, refinancing requirements will be high, with annual foreign exchange debt service requirements estimated at 7-8 percent of GDP over 2020-2022. The fiscal deficit is projected to expand further to over 11 percent of GDP in 2020, driving an increase in debt levels.Reflecting these challenges, the $3.20 poverty headcount is projected to increase from 8.9 percent in 2019 to 13 percent in 2020. During the lockdown, the government extended temporary cash support to Samurdhi households, including a large number of which were on the waitlist. But the program is not well targeted and benefit amounts are inadequate. Construction and services sectors, including tourism, have been important sources of jobs growth in recent years and the outbreak will likely harm the prospects of many low-skilled workers. The government is employing 60,000 graduates and 100,000 individuals from low-income families to support livelihoods, but this will remain insufficient and add further strain on public finance. A fall in remittances could adversely impact some poor households that rely on them as an important source of income.Risks and ChallengesA longer-than-expected outbreak of COVID-19, that would extend the horizon and depth of related economic disruptions, is a key risk to the baseline outlook. In turn, a longer downturn could push many small and medium enterprises from illiquidity to insolvency, and the poverty rate could rise even higher as more people suffer income losses. Low growth would also put additional strain on public finances.Sri Lanka is also highly exposed to global financial conditions, as the repayment profile of its debt requires the country to access financial markets frequently. A high deficit and rising debt levels could further deteriorate debt dynamics and negatively impact market sentiment. Thus, Sri Lanka will need to strike a balance between supporting the economy amid COVID-19 and ensuring fiscal sustainability.

Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, the economy grew at an average 5.3 percent during the period 2010-2019, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards reconstruction and growth; although growth slowed down in the last few years.The economy is transitioning from a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing and services. Social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries. Economic growth has translated into shared prosperity with the national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1 percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical pockets; however, a relatively large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the poverty line.Low fiscal revenues combined with largely non-discretionary expenditure in salary bill, transfers, and interest payments have constrained critical development spending on health, education and social protection, which is low compared to peer countries. Public debt levels are high while the overall debt portfolio indicate some important challenges.Recent developmentsAfter growing by 2.3 percent in 2019, the economy contracted by 1.6 percent y-o-y in the first quarter of 2020. The contraction, a first in 19 years, was driven by weak performances of construction, textile, mining and tea industries. Against this backdrop, the COVID-19 health crisis is believed to have impacted economic activity severely since the first quarter. High frequency indicators suggest that growth has faltered in the second quarter, as curfews impeded economic activity and global demand remained weak. Moreover, the closure of airports to tourists between April and September brought tourism activity to a standstill.Weak demand has kept inflation in check thus far in 2020, creating room for policy support. Annual average inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index was 4.1 percent in August 2020 despite high food inflation. This allowed the Central Bank to reduce policy rates by 250 basis points and the reserve ratio by 300 basis points over the first seven months of 2020. The Central Bank also introduced a refinancing facility and a credit guarantee scheme to encourage commercial banks to increase lending. Despite these measures, private credit growth remained subdued in the first half of 2020. Asset quality and earnings of the financial businesses deteriorated, reflecting the impact of decelerating loan recoveries and shrinking margins.The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed in the first half of 2020. A reduction in imports due to severe import restrictions is likely to have offset reduced receipts from remittances, tourism, tea and textiles. Following heavy depreciation pressures in March, the LKR stabilized in the second quarter, as import controls helped the current account. Official reserves, estimated at USD 7.4 billion as of August, remain low relative to short-term external liabilities. Included in reserves is a swap facility of USD 400 million with the Reserve Bank of India and a loan of USD 500 million from the China Development Bank. The Central Bank also secured a repo facility with the New York Federal Reserve Bank for USD 1.0 billion as a contingency measure. A Eurobond of USD 1.0 billion is maturing in October 2020.Fiscal accounts deteriorated in the first four months of 2020. Tax revenues fell short due to weak collection of value-added, income, and import taxes. The fiscal stimulus package implemented in November 2019 -which included a reduction of the VAT rate and an increase of the registration threshold, as well as import controls-, and slow growth contributed to the reduction in tax collection during this period. As a result, despite a moderation in public investment, the overall budget deficit increased by 24 percent in the first four months of 2020, year-on-year. Approximately half of the deficit was financed by Central Bank credit. The central government debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 90 percent (from 86.9 percent at end 2019), with more than half of the debt denominated in foreign currency. Citing limited fiscal buffers and external vulnerabilities, Fitch and S&P downgraded the sovereign rating to B-.The economic effects of COVID-19 will have significant welfare implications. Poverty measured using the $3.20 poverty line (in 2011 PPP) is estimated to have declined from 9.4 percent in 2018 to 8.9 percent in 2019. However, the COVID-19 crisis is believed to have triggered sharp jobs and earnings losses. Informal workers, about 70 percent of the workforce, are particularly vulnerable as they lack employment protection or paid leave. The apparel industry, which employs about half a million workers, has reportedly cut significant jobs. While agricultural production is expected to be largely undisrupted, weak external demand likely impacted export-oriented subsectors and wages. High food price inflation, which remains at double-digits, is disproportionately affecting the poor who spend a larger share of their budget on food.

        The World Bank Group and Sri LankaThe World Bank Group (WBG) has supported Sri Lanka’s development for over six decades and been a trusted development partner through many transitions. The WBG is now supporting the Government of Sri Lanka’s efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen its public health preparedness.In addition, in September 2020, the World Bank reallocated $56 million from ongoing projects to protect the most vulnerable in the country’s agriculture sector, improve COVID-19 protection measures on public transport, facilitate tele-education for school children, and provide digital solutions to improve delivery of public services. These funds were reallocated through the Contingency Emergency Response Components (CERC’s) of ongoing projects, with $17 million from the Local Development Support Project (LDSP); $15 million from the General Education Modernization Project (GEMP); $9 million from the Sri Lanka Primary Healthcare System Strengthening Project (PHSSP) and $15 million from the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP).Over time, the World Bank’s support for Si Lanka will evolve, enabling it to adapt to the aftermath of COVID-19. Country StrategyThe World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Sri Lanka for FY2017-20 is based on the Group’s 2015 Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) and the country’s own development priorities.The CPF supports Sri Lanka’s transition to a more competitive, inclusive, and resilient upper-middle income country. It focuses on three broad areas: i) macro-stability and competitiveness; (ii) inclusion and opportunities for all; and (iii) green growth and resilience—as well as the cross-cutting themes of gender and governance.In April 2019, at the midpoint of the CPF’s implementation, its progress was documented in a Performance and Learning Review (PLR).From FY2017, when Sri Lanka graduated from International Development Association (IDA), the WBG’s soft lending arm, IBRD lending has accounted for an increasing share of WBG commitments to the country. The IBRD share of the WBG’s Sri Lanka portfolio rose from 12 percent in June 2016 to 35 percent in September 2020.World Bank ProgramAs of September 2020, the WBG’s portfolio comprised of 19 IDA and IBRD projects, with a total net commitment of $2.36 billion.  Some 66 percent of these commitments were for sustainable development and infrastructure (urban, climate resilience, agriculture, environment, transport and water); 31 percent for human development (education, health and social protection); and 3 percent for equitable growth, finance and institutions (finance, competitiveness and innovation). Between July 2016 and September 2020, trust fund resources increased from $9.8 million to approximately $20 million, with 23 active grants as of September 21, 2020.The World Bank Group continues to support the Sri Lanka government’s development efforts by providing policy advice, analysis and technical assistance through trust funds and its own budget. This includes analytical work on investment policy and the business environment, and technical support for public financial management. Several activities have also helped lay the groundwork for more effective project interventions, notably in the health, water, and tourism sectors. In addition, the Group carried out structured diagnostics of the urban transport infrastructure and energy sectors and provided perspectives to support their development, including through WBG-assisted solutions.  The  WBG’s technical support for collecting poverty data and monitoring poverty levels contributed to a deeper understanding of the role of social assistance in poverty alleviation. This has already had significant policy impact. In addition, a series of biannual economic updates has developed a broad audience for timely economic analysis and forecasts for potential future trends.

        The World Bank Group supports Sri Lanka’s efforts to meet its various development goals.  Highlights include:HealthThe Primary Healthcare System Strengthening Project builds on an earlier $200-million Second Health Sector Development Project (closed in 2018). The project focuses on the detection and management of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and targeting the most vulnerable. Within the two years of implementation, NCD services expanded to 187 primary care institutions across the country, with all services functional in 62 Phase-1 primary care institutions. In 2019, the last year of the project, approximately 161,000 women aged 35-45 years were screened for cervical cancer at primary care institutions, exceeding targets. In recent years, substantial analytical work has informed government policies. This includes an assessment of the system for financing health care and the impact that COVID-19 has had on this, as well as a study on nutrition.The Sri Lanka COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project ($128.6 million), which was swiftly activated in April 2020, is supporting the government’s efforts to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak by strengthening the capacity of national and sub-national institutions to address immediate needs and equip them to handle future public health emergencies.EducationThe World Bank is helping the development of human capital across all levels of education and training. The Sri Lanka Early Childhood Development Project  is supporting children from disadvantaged households to access early learning opportunities. About 1.35 million children, half of whom are girls, have benefitted directly, along with teachers, parents, community members, and government officials.The General Education Modernization project, launched in October 2018, seeks to promote learning outcomes in English and Mathematics, develop the socio-emotional skills of students and enhance teacher performance. The Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development (AHEAD) is helping increase enrollment in priority disciplines for economic development, improve the labor market of degree programs, and promote research and development and innovations for economic growth.Social Protection & JobsThe World Bank is playing a pivotal role in the reform of Sri Lanka’s safety net through the $75 million IDA-financed Social Safety Nets Project. The project is developing an Integrated Welfare Management System (IWMS), a central online portal that will serve as a “one-stop shop” for Sri Lanka’s welfare programs. The IWMS contains data on almost 2.5 million low-income households, which will be continually updated by local officials once the system is active. The new IWMS will generate information that can be used to better identify and deliver the support for households, reduce overlaps and eliminate leakages in welfare programs. Through this project, the World Bank provided $45 million of financing to cover the cost of emergency income support to low-income households during the April/May 2020 curfew.Climate Change and Disaster Risk ManagementThe annual average fiscal loss associated with disasters in Sri Lanka is very high and is estimated to be already in excess of $380 million. Floods is the most frequent natural disaster, with an estimated annual loss of $240 million. The ongoing Climate Resilience Improvement Project  (CRIP), implemented since 2014,  has achieved major results: rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and the construction of physical protections against landslides along key corridors, school premises and other critical locations; and the development of basin-wide investment plans for 10 river basins based on the modern flood modeling approach. This led to the design of a new operation, the Climate Resilience Multi-Phase Program. The World Bank strengthened its support for Climate Change in Sri Lanka when Sri Lanka recognized its needs to access climate finance to scale up climate change mitigation activities.AgricultureThe agriculture sector still employs approximately 27 percent of the population, although its contribution declined to 6.9 percent of GDP. Around 80 percent of agricultural land is under smallholder production, with around 1.65 million smallholder farmers operating an average of less than 2 hectares each, with limited opportunities to diversify into higher-value products. The World Bank program in Sri Lanka responds to these challenges by addressing some long-standing issues around productivity, private sector investment, value chains, policy reform, and adaptation to climate change. A core principle of the program is private sector-led smallholder agricultural transformation. This involves a change in mindset among public institutions to recognize their role in creating the necessary conditions, stimulating private finance and bringing in private sector solutions. The Agriculture Sector Modernization Project (ASMP) includes different instruments to crowd in private finance and support the development of strategic market infrastructure, including roads. The observed impact of the scheme includes: i) the upgrading of standards in the food processing industry; ii) transformational change in specific sub-sectors, such as shrimp and ornamental fish; iii) creating more and better quality jobs; and iv) creating competitiveness and new markets through clustering and scale. The Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP) aims to improve the productivity and climate resilience of smallholder agriculture in select hotspots. To enable smallholder farmers to raise productivity, the project is linking them to value chains and pushing new applications of technology, including real-time agricultural-meteorological information. Both projects are assisting the Government of Sri Lanka in its program to ensure short- and medium-term food security during the COVID-19 pandemic.Water Supply and SanitationSri Lanka has made a significant progress in providing its people with basic water supply and sanitation. Some 92 percent of the population has access to improved drinking water and 94 percent to basic sanitation. The Government of Sri Lanka now aims to increase access to piped water to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. The Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project has made substantial contributions to providing 24-hour treated piped water supply and sanitation services in rural, peri-urban and estate areas in seven of the poorest districts in the country (Mullaithivu, Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Monaragala, Kegalle, and Ratnapura). In addition to constructing infrastructure, the project conducts extensive behavior change activities to promote hygiene, and trains and develops community based organizations to operate and maintain their water supply systems. The project aims to benefit more than 600,000 people with improved water supply and sanitation promoting water security, health and resilience.Urban DevelopmentThe Metro Colombo Urban Development Project (MCUDP) is supporting the government of Sri Lanka’s efforts to reduce flooding in the Colombo Water Basin.  The project is undertaking select investments to strengthen the capacity of the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA) authorities to rehabilitate, improve and maintain local infrastructure and services. The Project pioneered the use of urban wetlands as a nature-based solution for flood risk mitigation, building resilience to climate change, and improving urban livability. This has led to a moratorium on wetland reclamation within the metro Colombo area, and to an international recognition for Colombo as a Ramsar Wetland City  - the first capital in the world to receive this award. The project has also improved public space in Colombo and rehabilitated 47 km of road. It is financing large and complex flood management investments across the city, including a network of pumping stations, protecting the banks of canals, and drainage tunnels. Once all sub-projects are completed, flood risk will be reduced to 4.0 - 4.3 km2 for the whole of Colombo, and 3.7 – 3.9 km2 for the project area. The population exposed to flood risk will be reduced by 27 percent for the project area and 12 percent for the whole Colombo.The Strategic Cities Development Project is helping upgrade urban infrastructure in Kandy, Galle and Jaffna—three strategic urban centers in the center, south, and north of the country. The project is supporting investments in urban water supply, sewage and drainage systems, rehabilitating cultural heritage, and improving urban transport and traffic management, among other areas. To date, approximately 400,000 people in these cities have benefitted from improved basic services. These range from improved reservoirs, water treatment, distribution, and sludge treatment, to better public spaces such as parks and viewing decks, and drainage improvements.The Local Development Support Project is supporting the Government of Sri Lanka to strengthen 134 Local Government Authorities (LGAs) in the Northern, Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces to deliver services to communities in a responsive and accountable manner and to support the development of infrastructure. The project aims to establish a reliable and predictable flow of resources enabling LGAs to establish and use improved measurement systems; boost results-based planning and budgeting; and upgrade the management and delivery of a range of services.TransportThe Transport Connectivity and Asset Management Project (TCAMP) is supporting the Government of Sri Lanka’s efforts to strengthen road asset management at the national level and improve provincial roads in all the nine provinces of the country. The project is supporting the operationalization of the Sri Lanka Road Asset Management System (SLRAMS). Once fully operational, the system will help the Road Development Authority (RDA) to ensure the best use of scarce resources and reduce costs for planning, developing and maintaining roads. The project is also helping the RDA to assess the safety of certain high-risk national corridors and strengthen their capacity to design safer roads. Approximately 430 km of provincial roads, spread across all nine provinces of the country, are planned to be rehabilitated under the project, improving the connectivity of the provinces. Overall, the project has the potential to create about 1.3 million man-days of employment.The Kandy Multimodal Transport Terminal Development Project (KMTTDP) is a transformational urban mobility project which supports Sri Lanka in improving the accessibility and safety of public transport, and reducing congestion in the world heritage city of Kandy. The project will support the development of a modern multimodal transport terminal which integrates bus and rail transport, replacing the existing bus station. The project will facilitate the training of all relevant stakeholders for the operation of a multimodal terminal of this nature. It will also explore the potential for transit-oriented development (TOD) by locating amenities, employment, retail shops, and housing around the terminal, improve road safety and promote nonmotorized travel.

        Vietnam’s development over the past 30 years has been remarkable. Economic and political reforms under Đổi Mới, launched in 1986, have spurred rapid economic growth, transforming what was then one of the world’s poorest nations into a lower middle-income country. Between 2002 and 2018, GDP per capita increased by 2.7 times, reaching over US$2,700 in 2019, and more than 45 million people were lifted out of poverty. Poverty rates declined sharply from over 70 percent to below 6 percent (US$3.2/day PPP). The vast majority of Vietnam’s remaining poor – 86 percent – are ethnic minorities.In 2019, Vietnam’s economy continued to show fundamental strength and resilience, supported by robust domestic demand and export-oriented manufacturing. Real  GDP grew by an estimated 7 percent in 2019, similar to 2018, one of the fastest growth rates in the region.Given its deep integration with the global economy, the Vietnamese economy has been hit hard by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown remarkable resilience. The initial health impact of the outbreak had not been as severe in Vietnam as in other countries due to proactive measures at the national and subnational levels. The macro-economic and fiscal framework remains resilient with an estimated GDP growth rate of 1.8 percent in the first half of 2020, projected to reach 2.8 percent for the year. Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world not to expect a recession, though its growth rate for this year is far less than the typical 6-7 percent pre-crisis projections. However, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is hard to predict given the uncertainty surrounding its magnitude and duration. Public financing requirements will increase as the result of lower revenue and higher spending due to the stimulus package launched  to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemics on households and businesses.Thanks to its strong fundamentals, and assuming the relative control of the COVID-19 pandemic both in Vietnam and the world, the Vietnamese economy should rebound in 2021. COVID-19 has also shown the necessity for stronger reforms to help the economy recover in the medium term, such as improving business environment, promoting the digital economy, and enhancing public investment effectiveness and efficiency, which are some of the key agendas for Vietnam to consider stronger and faster reform actions.Vietnam is experiencing rapid demographic and social change. Its population reached 96.5 million in 2019 (up from about 60 million in 1986) and is expected to expand to 120 million by 2050. Today, 70 percent of the population is under 35 years of age, with a life expectancy of 76 years, the highest among countries in the region at similar income levels. But the population is rapidly aging. And Vietnam’s emerging middle class, currently accounting for 13 percent of the population, is expected to reach 26 percent by 2026.Between 2010 and 2020, the Human Capital Index for Vietnam increases from 0.66 to 0.69. A Vietnamese child born today will be 69 percent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. Vietnam’s HCI is the highest among middle-income countries, but there are some disparities within the country, especially for ethnic minorities. There is also a need to upgrade the skills of the workforce to create productive jobs at a large scale in the future.Health outcomes have improved in tandem with rising living standards. From 1993 to 2017, the infant mortality rate decreased from 32.6 to 16.7 (per 1,000 live births). Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased from 70.5 to 76.3 years, and is the highest in the region for countries at a similar income level. Vietnam’s universal health coverage index is at 73—higher than regional and global averages—with 87 percent of the population covered. However, the high and widening sex ratio at birth (115 in 2018) shows that fundamental gender discrimination persists. At the same time, Vietnam is one of the most rapidly aging countries and the 65+ age group is expected to increase 2.5 times by 2050.Over the past 30 years, the provision of basic services has improved significantly. Access of households to infrastructure services has increased dramatically. As of 2016, 99 percent of the population uses electricity as their main source of lighting, up from just 14 percent in 1993. Access to clean water in rural areas has also improved, up from 17 percent in 1993 to 70 percent in 2016, while that figure for urban areas is above 95 percent. However, in recent years, Vietnam’s physical capital investment as a percentage of GDP has been among the lowest in the ASEAN region. This will create challenges for continued growth of modern infrastructure services required for the next phase of growth (Vietnam ranks 89th out of 137 countries for quality of its infrastructure).Vietnam’s rapid growth and industrialization have had detrimental impacts on the environment and natural assets.  Electricity consumption has tripled over the past decade, growing faster than output. Given the increasing reliance of fossil fuels, the power sector itself accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. There is an urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition. Over the past two decades, Vietnam has emerged as the fastest growing per-capita greenhouse gas emitters in the world – growing at about 5 percent annually. Demand for water continues to increase, while water productivity is low, about 12 percent of global benchmarks. Unsustainable exploitation of natural assets such as sand, fisheries, and timber could negatively affect prospects for long-term growth. Compounding the problem is the reality that much of Vietnam’s population and economy is highly vulnerable to climate impacts.Urbanization and strong economic and population growth are causing rapidly increasing waste management and pollution challenges. Waste generation in Vietnam is expected to double in less than 15 years. Linked to this is the issue of marine plastics. Ninety percent of global marine plastic pollution is estimated to come from just 10 in-land rivers, and the Mekong river is one of them. Vietnam is among the 10 countries worldwide that are most affected by air pollution. Water pollution has significant costs on productivity of key sectors and human health.The government is working to lower the environmental footprint of the country’s growth and effectively mitigate and adapt to climate change. Key strategies and plans to stimulate green growth and sustainable use of its natural assets are in place. The government is also implementing measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change and address extreme weather events and natural disasters by operationalizing its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world not to expect a recession, though its growth rate for this year is far less than the typical 6-7 percent pre-crisis projections. However, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is hard to predict given the uncertainty surrounding its magnitude and duration. Public financing requirements will increase as the result of lower revenue and higher spending due to the stimulus package launched  to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemics on households and businesses.Thanks to its strong fundamentals, and assuming the relative control of the COVID-19 pandemic both in Vietnam and the world, the Vietnamese economy should rebound in 2021. COVID-19 has also shown the necessity for stronger reforms to help the economy recover in the medium term, such as improving business environment, promoting the digital economy, and enhancing public investment effectiveness and efficiency, which are some of the key agendas for Vietnam to consider stronger and faster reform actions.Vietnam is experiencing rapid demographic and social change. Its population reached 96.5 million in 2019 (up from about 60 million in 1986) and is expected to expand to 120 million by 2050. Today, 70 percent of the population is under 35 years of age, with a life expectancy of 76 years, the highest among countries in the region at similar income levels. But the population is rapidly aging. And Vietnam’s emerging middle class, currently accounting for 13 percent of the population, is expected to reach 26 percent by 2026.Between 2010 and 2020, the Human Capital Index for Vietnam increases from 0.66 to 0.69. A Vietnamese child born today will be 69 percent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. Vietnam’s HCI is the highest among middle-income countries, but there are some disparities within the country, especially for ethnic minorities. There is also a need to upgrade the skills of the workforce to create productive jobs at a large scale in the future.Health outcomes have improved in tandem with rising living standards. From 1993 to 2017, the infant mortality rate decreased from 32.6 to 16.7 (per 1,000 live births). Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased from 70.5 to 76.3 years, and is the highest in the region for countries at a similar income level. Vietnam’s universal health coverage index is at 73—higher than regional and global averages—with 87 percent of the population covered. However, the high and widening sex ratio at birth (115 in 2018) shows that fundamental gender discrimination persists. At the same time, Vietnam is one of the most rapidly aging countries and the 65+ age group is expected to increase 2.5 times by 2050.Over the past 30 years, the provision of basic services has improved significantly. Access of households to infrastructure services has increased dramatically. As of 2016, 99 percent of the population uses electricity as their main source of lighting, up from just 14 percent in 1993. Access to clean water in rural areas has also improved, up from 17 percent in 1993 to 70 percent in 2016, while that figure for urban areas is above 95 percent. However, in recent years, Vietnam’s physical capital investment as a percentage of GDP has been among the lowest in the ASEAN region. This will create challenges for continued growth of modern infrastructure services required for the next phase of growth (Vietnam ranks 89th out of 137 countries for quality of its infrastructure).Vietnam’s rapid growth and industrialization have had detrimental impacts on the environment and natural assets.  Electricity consumption has tripled over the past decade, growing faster than output. Given the increasing reliance of fossil fuels, the power sector itself accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. There is an urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition. Over the past two decades, Vietnam has emerged as the fastest growing per-capita greenhouse gas emitters in the world – growing at about 5 percent annually. Demand for water continues to increase, while water productivity is low, about 12 percent of global benchmarks. Unsustainable exploitation of natural assets such as sand, fisheries, and timber could negatively affect prospects for long-term growth.

        Vietnam’s development over the past 30 years has been remarkable. Economic and political reforms under Đổi Mới, launched in 1986, have spurred rapid economic growth, transforming what was then one of the world’s poorest nations into a lower middle-income country. Between 2002 and 2018, GDP per capita increased by 2.7 times, reaching over US$2,700 in 2019, and more than 45 million people were lifted out of poverty. Poverty rates declined sharply from over 70 percent to below 6 percent (US$3.2/day PPP). The vast majority of Vietnam’s remaining poor – 86 percent – are ethnic minorities.In 2019, Vietnam’s economy continued to show fundamental strength and resilience, supported by robust domestic demand and export-oriented manufacturing. Real  GDP grew by an estimated 7 percent in 2019, similar to 2018, one of the fastest growth rates in the region.Given its deep integration with the global economy, the Vietnamese economy has been hit hard by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown remarkable resilience. The initial health impact of the outbreak had not been as severe in Vietnam as in other countries due to proactive measures at the national and subnational levels. The macro-economic and fiscal framework remains resilient with an estimated GDP growth rate of 1.8 percent in the first half of 2020, projected to reach 2.8 percent for the year. Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world not to expect a recession, though its growth rate for this year is far less than the typical 6-7 percent pre-crisis projections. However, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is hard to predict given the uncertainty surrounding its magnitude and duration. Public financing requirements will increase as the result of lower revenue and higher spending due to the stimulus package launched  to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemics on households and businesses.Thanks to its strong fundamentals, and assuming the relative control of the COVID-19 pandemic both in Vietnam and the world, the Vietnamese economy should rebound in 2021. COVID-19 has also shown the necessity for stronger reforms to help the economy recover in the medium term, such as improving business environment, promoting the digital economy, and enhancing public investment effectiveness and efficiency, which are some of the key agendas for Vietnam to consider stronger and faster reform actions.Vietnam is experiencing rapid demographic and social change. Its population reached 96.5 million in 2019 (up from about 60 million in 1986) and is expected to expand to 120 million by 2050. Today, 70 percent of the population is under 35 years of age, with a life expectancy of 76 years, the highest among countries in the region at similar income levels. But the population is rapidly aging. And Vietnam’s emerging middle class, currently accounting for 13 percent of the population, is expected to reach 26 percent by 2026.Between 2010 and 2020, the Human Capital Index for Vietnam increases from 0.66 to 0.69. A Vietnamese child born today will be 69 percent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. Vietnam’s HCI is the highest among middle-income countries, but there are some disparities within the country, especially for ethnic minorities. There is also a need to upgrade the skills of the workforce to create productive jobs at a large scale in the future.Health outcomes have improved in tandem with rising living standards. From 1993 to 2017, the infant mortality rate decreased from 32.6 to 16.7 (per 1,000 live births). Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased from 70.5 to 76.3 years, and is the highest in the region for countries at a similar income level. Vietnam’s universal health coverage index is at 73—higher than regional and global averages—with 87 percent of the population covered. However, the high and widening sex ratio at birth (115 in 2018) shows that fundamental gender discrimination persists. At the same time, Vietnam is one of the most rapidly aging countries and the 65+ age group is expected to increase 2.5 times by 2050.Over the past 30 years, the provision of basic services has improved significantly. Access of households to infrastructure services has increased dramatically. As of 2016, 99 percent of the population uses electricity as their main source of lighting, up from just 14 percent in 1993. Access to clean water in rural areas has also improved, up from 17 percent in 1993 to 70 percent in 2016, while that figure for urban areas is above 95 percent. However, in recent years, Vietnam’s physical capital investment as a percentage of GDP has been among the lowest in the ASEAN region. This will create challenges for continued growth of modern infrastructure services required for the next phase of growth (Vietnam ranks 89th out of 137 countries for quality of its infrastructure).Vietnam’s rapid growth and industrialization have had detrimental impacts on the environment and natural assets.  Electricity consumption has tripled over the past decade, growing faster than output. Given the increasing reliance of fossil fuels, the power sector itself accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. There is an urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition. Over the past two decades, Vietnam has emerged as the fastest growing per-capita greenhouse gas emitters in the world – growing at about 5 percent annually. Demand for water continues to increase, while water productivity is low, about 12 percent of global benchmarks. Unsustainable exploitation of natural assets such as sand, fisheries, and timber could negatively affect prospects for long-term growth. Compounding the problem is the reality that much of Vietnam’s population and economy is highly vulnerable to climate impacts.Urbanization and strong economic and population growth are causing rapidly increasing waste management and pollution challenges. Waste generation in Vietnam is expected to double in less than 15 years. Linked to this is the issue of marine plastics.

        The current World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Vietnam guides the Bank Group's engagements in the country from 2018 to 2022.Endorsed on May 30, 2017, and reflecting and building on the priorities identified and expressed in the World Bank Group's 2016 Systematic Country Diagnostic, the Vietnam 2035 Report, and the Government of Vietnam’s 2016-2020 Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), the CPF has four priority areas:Enable inclusive growth and private sector participationInvest in people and knowledgeEnsure environmental sustainability and resiliencePromote good governanceBuilding on the World Bank Group’s continued strong engagement in Vietnam, the CPF introduces strategic shifts that will guide the Group’s work going forward:Comprehensive engagement to strengthen private sector development and participation across sectors;Support to achieve the financial sustainability of public services and transfers;Support to poverty reduction amongst ethnic minorities, through livelihood and income generation activities;Multisector engagements to strengthen linkages between education and the labor market; andPromote and stimulate low carbon energy generation.The World Bank Group conducted a Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the CPF in early 2019. It confirmed the relevance of the current CPF, aligned with the government of Vietnam’s development objectives and demand for WBG support. It also broadened engagements to improve the welfare and development of ethnic minority groups and implementation of Vietnam’s Nationally Determined Contributions to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Achievement of the objectives set forth in the CPF results framework are largely on track, following the implementation of a large WB lending portfolio that includes many projects approved under IDA18 and IBRD, strong International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance, and the implementation of a comprehensive Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) portfolio supporting and informing key policy and reform areas.

        As of October 6, 2020, the Bank has provided US$24.94 billion in grants, credits, and concessional loans to Vietnam through 210 operations. Vietnam's existing portfolio consists of 39 active projects, with total net commitments of US$7.41 billion. In addition, Vietnam benefits from a large and diverse portfolio of Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA), with 33 currently active tasks. Many ASA engagements leverage country-level partnerships and trust funds from development partners.Clean EnergyThe Trung Son Hydropower Project supported the development of a 260-megawatt, grid-connected hydropower plant in the remote part of central Vietnam. Fully operational since 2017, the plant has supplied 1 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually at a levelized cost lower than other renewable sources or coal. The hydro plant reduced GHG emissions by approximately 1 million tons compared to a thermal plant supplying the same volume of electricity.The project increased the percentage of the local population with access to electricity from 30 percent in 2015 to 97 percent in 2019 – while contributing to improved quality of electricity supply in the broader region. The plant has also helped mitigate flood risks in downstream communities.  The Vietnam Renewable Energy Development Project supported some of the first large-scale private-sector led deployments of renewable energy into Vietnam’s power mix, which has significantly expanded today, accounting for nearly 10 percent of Vietnam’s power generation capacity. The project which closed in FY19 provided early-stage investment and technical support to build the requisite capacity and incentives among all stakeholders for scaled-up development. In addition, 19 new small hydropower plants were built with a total capacity of 320MW, which supplied an annual volume of 1,260GWh. All these plants followed global best practices on environmental and social risk management, setting new industry benchmarks in Vietnam.Environment and Natural Resources  Through the Climate Change and Green Growth Development Financing, the World Bank made a strong contribution to the climate change and green growth reform agenda. One pillar helped improve inter-sectoral coastal planning and mainstream climate change into public investment across selected key sectors. In addition, policies supported by this program helped promote the uptake of water-efficient irrigation practices and technologies – and prompted provinces to establish protection corridors for main water sources. Reforms brought about by this program also contributed to improved energy efficiency of household appliances and increased investment in renewable energy, particularly solar power and wind power.The Coastal Resources for Sustainable Development Project introduced tools and practices for better fisheries management to authorities and fishermen alike, along eight coastal provinces in Vietnam. Between 2012 and 2018, the project supported 40 coastal districts and 257 coastal communes to shift from fragmented sectoral planning to an integrated spatial planning for co-management of fisheries. The project also assisted 13,000 fishers in adopting good aquaculture practices with the introduction of new eco-friendly technologies, while helping improve the biosecurity infrastructure in which they operate.The Vietnam Industrial Pollution Management Project has significantly improved compliance with industrial wastewater treatment regulations in four of the most industrialized provinces in Vietnam. About 70 percent of water discharged from industrial zones was untreated. Between 2012 and 2018, the percentage of industrial zones compliant with wastewater treatment regulations increased from less than 30 percent to 72 percent. During the same period, the percentage of those with an on-site centralized effluent treatment plant increased from 60 percent to 98 percent. This is significant given that the number of industrial zones has increased by 26.4 percent.The Vietnam Hospital Waste Management Support Project helped reduce the healthcare wastewater and solid waste by 30 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The project financed the installation of waste treatment system in 218 hospitals across 55 cities and provinces. The project also helped strengthen the legal framework for medical waste management in Vietnam.Urban DevelopmentThe Mekong Delta Region Urban Upgrading Project has turned low-income, low-lying areas into greener urban spaces in six cities of the Mekong Delta Region. The project has helped improve the living conditions of about 625,000 direct beneficiaries by upgrading basic infrastructure. An additional two million people indirectly benefited from the city-wide infrastructure improvements and the new social facilities. The long-term benefits go beyond the duration of the project. The total quantifiable benefits are estimated at approximately US$724 million in terms of saving in healthcare costs, productive time, flood control damage, and increased land value.Rural DevelopmentThe Results-Based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Under the National Target Program has helped address one of the biggest challenges in rural Vietnam by investing in physical infrastructure and improving the legal framework for sustained access to water supply and sanitation (WSS) services. Between 2013 and 2019, more than 1 million people had their water supply connected to sustainable water systems, while 400,000 new functioning water supply connections were built. In addition, about 1.4 million people in 203 communes gained access to commune-wide sanitation. Improved sanitary latrines were built in some 142,000 households and 1,500 schools. The program also significantly strengthened institutional mechanisms for WSS monitoring, and evaluation processes within the implementing agencies of participating provinces.        Human CapitalVietnam joined the Human Capital Project in 2019 to improve nutrition and access to quality education and to enhance workforce development for a changing economy. The World Bank has supported Vietnam in reforming the educational system at all levels. The School Readiness Promotion Project, for example, helped increase access to full-day preschool to 84 percent of five-year-old children in 2015  from 66 percent in 2011. The quality of preschool instruction improved through the introduction of a child-centered learning approach for 250,000 early childhood education teachers. The Bank also provides strategic advice for Vietnam on how to prepare its workforce for future jobs.Poverty ReductionVietnam has made great strides in reducing poverty and improving quality of life for millions. The World Bank has worked closely with Vietnam to address the last miles in poverty eradication as approximately 8 million of Vietnamese people still lived with less than US$3.2 per day in 2018. The Second Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project, implemented in six mountainous provinces in the poorest region of Vietnam during 2010-2018, exemplifies this productive partnership. The project aimed to enhance the living standards of ethnic minorities by improving their access to productive infrastructure, building capacity of local governments and communities, and promoting market linkages and business innovations. The project, which benefited 192,000 households and resulted in a 16-percent increase in incomes, provided good lessons for government to revise its poverty reduction policy and approach.Governance ReformsImproving the efficiency and integrity of the public sector is a priority for the World Bank in Vietnam. The World Bank is supporting Vietnam’s Office of the Government (OOG) in its efforts to strengthen the delivery mechanisms in administrative procedures and e-government reforms during the 2018-2020 period. OOG launched the National Public Services Portal in December and E-Cabinet in June 2019. In February 2019, the Bank and OOG conducted a readiness assessment to ascertain the potential for digital government development in Vietnam. Earlier, the Bank conducted a ground-breaking study on conflict–of–interest issues in the context of growing interactions interactions between the public and private sectors.

        With a surface area equivalent to that of Western Europe, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa.  While its poverty rate has fallen slightly over the past two decades, particularly in rural areas, the DRC nonetheless remains one of the poorest countries in the world. In 2018, 72% of the population, especially in the North West and Kasaï regions, was living in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 a day.Political ContextThe DRC is still recovering from a series of conflicts that broke out in the 1990s. After several postponements of the presidential elections, Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo—the son of Etienne Tshisekedi, the country’s longstanding opposition leader—won the December 2018 election, succeeding Joseph Kabila who had been at the country’s helm for 18 years.Economic SituationAfter reaching 5.8% in 2018, economic growth slowed to 4.4% in 2019, owing to the drop in commodity prices, particularly for cobalt and copper, which account for over 80% of the country’s exports.The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is expected to trigger an economic recession (-2.2%) in 2020, stemming from weaker exports caused by the global economic downturn. However, the gradual recovery of global economic activity and the start of production at the Kamoa-Kakula mine should pave the way for a rebound in economic growth to 4.5% in 2022.Higher spending and revenue stagnation widened the fiscal deficit from close to balance in 2018 to a deficit of 2% of GDP in 2019. Additional public expenditures covered mainly civil service salary increases, free basic education, and infrastructure projects. Declining tax revenues are attributable in part to low corporate income tax collection, especially in the mining sector.The latest sustainability estimates show that the debt risk remains moderate. However, fairly weak revenues are limiting the government’s flexibility to implement fiscal policies aimed at tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.The current account deficit widened to 4.2% of GDP in 2019 (against 3.6% of GDP in 2018), owing to the deterioration in the terms of trade and lower export volumes. Capital inflows and other financial flows in 2019, including foreign direct investments (FDI), have helped protect official reserves, limit the depreciation of the Congolese franc, and curb inflation.Although the DRC initiated reforms aimed at strengthening governance in the management of natural resources and improving the business climate, the country is ranked 184 out of 190 countries in the Doing Business 2019  report on business regulations and must address a host of challenges if it hopes to attract investors in key sectors.Social Context and Development ChallengesThe DRC is making headway against the Ebola epidemic, which has been raging for almost two years in the Nord Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces, where 3,453 cases and over 2,200 deaths have been reported.The country has also been battling the COVID-19 pandemic since March 10, 2020 and is currently implementing urgent measures to contain its spread.The DRC ranks 135 out of 157 countries in terms of human capital, with a   human capital index  score of 0.37%, which is below the average in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.40). This means that a child born today will be 37% less productive in adulthood than a child who received a complete education and proper health care. Congolese children spend an average of 9.2 years in school and 43% of children are malnourished.Currently, 43% of households have access to drinking water (69% in urban areas, 23% in rural areas) and only 20% have access to sanitation. With an average of 6.1 children per woman, the DRC’s fertility rate is higher than the Sub-Saharan average (4.8). The early childbearing rate is equally high, with 125.24 births per 1,000 adolescent girls (15-19 years).

        The World Bank reengaged with the DRC in 2001, after nearly a decade of suspension of its activities, gradually shifting from emergency assistance to a sustainable development strategy.World Bank Group engagement in the DRC is guided by a Country Partnership Framework  that is reassessed and renewed on average every four to five years. The World Bank is currently drafting its new Country Partnership Framework for the 2020-2024 period, following its preparation of the Systematic Country Diagnostic of the economic and social situation in the DRC. The World Bank Group has adopted a new multisectoral approach in smaller geographic areas with concentrated poverty, in order to facilitate monitoring of project activities and make a greater impact.It will conduct activities in 26 provinces, which account for a mere 20% of the territory, but are home to 50% of the country’s poorest residents.  This geographic selection is based on a data analysis of poverty concentration, economic corridors, accessibility, and fragility.  In this connection, the World Bank opened a liaison office in Goma in Nord Kivu province and plans to open another in Kananga, in Kasaï Central province.As of September 1, 2019, the World Bank was financing 27 national projects and 4 regional projects valued at a total of $3.9 billion. These projects cover many key development areas:Human capital: health, women’s empowerment, social protection, and education;Sustainable development: infrastructure and connectivity, agriculture and food security, access to electricity and water, and urban development;Governance and private sector developmentOn April 2, 2020, the World Bank provided $47 million in emergency financing to help the country respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After several postponements of the presidential elections, Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo—the son of Etienne Tshisekedi, the country’s longstanding opposition leader—won the December 2018 election, succeeding Joseph Kabila who had been at the country’s helm for 18 years.Economic SituationAfter reaching 5.8% in 2018, economic growth slowed to 4.4% in 2019, owing to the drop in commodity prices, particularly for cobalt and copper, which account for over 80% of the country’s exports.The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is expected to trigger an economic recession (-2.2%) in 2020, stemming from weaker exports caused by the global economic downturn. However, the gradual recovery of global economic activity and the start of production at the Kamoa-Kakula mine should pave the way for a rebound in economic growth to 4.5% in 2022.Higher spending and revenue stagnation widened the fiscal deficit from close to balance in 2018 to a deficit of 2% of GDP in 2019. Additional public expenditures covered mainly civil service salary increases, free basic education, and infrastructure projects. Declining tax revenues are attributable in part to low corporate income tax collection, especially in the mining sector.The latest sustainability estimates show that the debt risk remains moderate. However, fairly weak revenues are limiting the government’s flexibility to implement fiscal policies aimed at tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.The current account deficit widened to 4.2% of GDP in 2019 (against 3.6% of GDP in 2018), owing to the deterioration in the terms of trade and lower export volumes. Capital inflows and other financial flows in 2019, including foreign direct investments (FDI), have helped protect official reserves, limit the depreciation of the Congolese franc, and curb inflation.Although the DRC initiated reforms aimed at strengthening governance in the management of natural resources and improving the business climate, the country is ranked 184 out of 190 countries in the Doing Business 2019  report on business regulations and must address a host of challenges if it hopes to attract investors in key sectors.Social Context and Development ChallengesThe DRC is making headway against the Ebola epidemic, which has been raging for almost two years in the Nord Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces, where 3,453 cases and over 2,200 deaths have been reported.The country has also been battling the COVID-19 pandemic since March 10, 2020 and is currently implementing urgent measures to contain its spread.The DRC ranks 135 out of 157 countries in terms of human capital, with a   human capital index  score of 0.37%, which is below the average in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.40). This means that a child born today will be 37% less productive in adulthood than a child who received a complete education and proper health care. Congolese children spend an average of 9.2 years in school and 43% of children are malnourished.Currently, 43% of households have access to drinking water (69% in urban areas, 23% in rural areas) and only 20% have access to sanitation. With an average of 6.1 children per woman, the DRC’s fertility rate is higher than the Sub-Saharan average (4.8). The early childbearing rate is equally high, with 125.24 births per 1,000 adolescent girls (15-19 years).

        Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a remarkable diversity of geographic and natural resources. The country occupies the eastern half of the West Pacific island of New Guinea, together with the main islands of New Britain, New Ireland, and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, as well as another 600 smaller islands and atolls.PNG’s population of eight million people is young and growing. PNG’s growth trajectory and abundant resource potential provides a strong platform for greater economic engagement with Asia and beyond.The country’s economy remains dominated by two broad sectors:the agricultural, forestry, and fishing sectors that engage most of PNG’s labor force (the majority informally); andthe minerals and energy extraction sector that accounts for the majority of export earnings and GDP.To diversify PNG’s sources of revenue and increase employment, investment is needed to strengthen capacity in institutions, human capital, and physical infrastructure like electricity, telecommunications, road and other transport infrastructure that remain critical to supporting private sector-led growth.PNG has complex cultural dynamics deeply rooted in tribal and ethnic identity, traditional social institutions, and relationships to the land. These contribute to both the country’s unique challenges as well as its considerable resilience.There are limited formal job opportunities for the growing employment age population and other risks include environmental management, population growth, political fragmentation, inequalities in PNG’s resource dominated economy, and social exclusion.In July 2020, the World Bank forecast that – compared to previous forecasts in January – real GDP growth will drop by 4.2 percentage points (to -1.3 percent) due to weaker demand and less favorable terms of trade as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. This will lead to a larger fiscal deficit, financing gaps, and higher unemployment and poverty than previously anticipated prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic..With such a highly dispersed and remote population with 87% of Papua New Guineans living in rural areas, the consequences of a COVID-19 outbreak in PNG has the potential to be devastating. The future resilience and economic growth of the country will depend on how its health system responds to the pandemic in 2020. The World Bank continues to support the Government of PNG to strengthen macroeconomic management and improve service delivery to ensure development benefits reach Papua New Guineans, particularly given 87% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas.

        The World Bank Group continues to grow its presence across Papua New Guinea (PNG) and is committed to responding swiftly to the country’s most pressing issues. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank approved an emergency US$20 million (approximately PGK70m) project for PNG focused on protecting health workers and others in the response effort, helping PNG health authorities quickly scale-up testing capacity, and strengthening public education to combat the spread of the virus.The commitment is part of a wider package of World Bank support to tackle a number of PNG’s most pressing health challenges. The US$15 million Emergency Tuberculosis (TB) Project is now in its third year, and in April 2020 the US$30 million IMPACT Health project was announced that will strengthen the quality of health services, particularly in rural areas. This new project aims to address the quality and efficiency of health services being delivered in clinics and hospitals across the country. The project will initially be piloted in two PNG provinces – Enga and East New Britain – with the plan to expand to further provinces by the project’s third year. Long-term support to PNG was outlined in May 2019 when the World Bank and PNG Government agreed on the 2019-2022 Country Partnership Framework for Papua New Guinea.The five-year strategy is aligned with the country’s development plans, and lays out three main focus areas for work by the World Bank Group in PNG:·         improve the country’s macro and fiscal resilience;·         ensure more effective and inclusive services, particularly in remote and underserved areas; and·         diversify the economy and create jobs, including through the non-resources sector.Strengthening governance in both the natural resources sector and across management of public resources underpins the World Bank’s strategy in PNG. The strategy aims to ensure everyone, regardless of their gender, where they live, or their social and economic circumstances, will benefit equally from the World Bank’s work to support PNG’s development goals.In 2018, the World Bank launched the Human Capital Project, an ambitious global initiative to accelerate investments in people around the world – work that is critically important in PNG. The Human Capital Index shows that, on average, a child born today in PNG will be only 38% as productive when he or she grows up as they would have been if they had access to optimal health and education services. Based on these results, PNG was one of the first countries worldwide to commit to the Human Capital Project.The World Bank is also strengthening its analysis of PNG’s economic challenges and prospects, with the publication of twice-yearly PNG Economic Update reports.

        COVID-19 is unquestionably a significant threat to public health in Papua New Guinea (PNG), with the World Bank responding with US$20m in emergency response funding for 600,000 pieces of Personal Protective Equipment for health workers, critical supplies and facilities for testing, as well as funding for extensive public education activities, all across the country.The threat posed by COVID-19 is further compounded by PNG’s high rates of drug-resistant Tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant health threat in a number of PNG’s provinces. Daru, a small island in Western Province, is a global hot spot for multi-drug-resistant TB. The World Bank has contributed US$15 million to the multi-partner Emergency Tuberculosis Project to help kick TB out of PNG with improved screening, diagnosis and treatment programs. Patient treatment drop-out rates have now reduced from 30% to zero on Daru Island. Since first hitting the road in late 2017, the project’s mobile X-ray screening van has already screened more than 6,500 people – nearly half of the entire population of Daru – with the project now expanding to other parts of PNG, including the National Capital District (Port Moresby).The Productive Partnership in Agriculture Project (PPAP) is PNG’s largest agriculture program. Launched in 2010, the project has improved the livelihoods of more than 67,000 smallholder cocoa and coffee producers across PNG, with more than three million cocoa trees and more than seven million coffee trees replanted or rehabilitated as part of the project. The project also includes a strong focus on increasing support to women farmers. The World Bank is now supporting the PNG Government to build on the successes of this project to also include coconut, spices and small livestock, with the new, five-year, US$40 million PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification Project approved in April 2020.In the capital, Port Moresby, the Urban Youth Employment Project has provided thousands of young Papua New Guineans with life skills and short-term employment opportunities. Jointly funded by the Australian Government (DFAT) and the Government of Papua New Guinea, with support from the Republic of Korea and the private sector, the project has helped 18,500 long-term unemployed young Papua New Guineans – 40% of whom are women – undertake vocational training and fully-subsidized work placements. In doing so, it created 18,000 new bank accounts and over 815,000 days of work, with 85% of community members in project locations reporting that crime and violence had reduced. The US$35 million second phase of the project began in April 2020 and will support 6,700 young people in Port Moresby and country’s second largest city, Lae. Poor road conditions mean that for many people in PNG, travel by road can be impossible, unsafe or simply far too expensive. Without reliable access to roads, people cannot reach schools, hospitals or markets when they need to. Now in its second phase, the World Bank’s Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project has already restored more than 160 kilometers of roads across PNG. More than 50 national and provincial bridges have also been rehabilitated, maintained and/or replaced and an estimated 1.3 million people (27% of the population) have benefitted from this support.

        Over the past two decades, Cambodia has undergone a significant transition, reaching lower middle-income status in 2015 and aspiring to attain upper middle-income status by 2030. Driven by garment exports and tourism, Cambodia’s economy has sustained an average growth rate of 8% between 1998 and 2018, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. While easing slightly, growth remained strong, estimated to have reached 7.1% in 2019, after the better-than-expected growth rate of 7.5% in 2018.The global shock triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Cambodia’s economy in 2020 at a time when Cambodia also faces the partial suspension of preferential access to the EU market under the “Everything but Arms” initiative. The outbreak caused sharp deceleration in most of Cambodia’s main engines of growth—tourism, manufacturing exports, and construction—which together account for more than 70% of the country’s growth and almost 40% of paid employment. The economy in 2020 is projected to register negative growth of -2%, the sharpest decline in Cambodia’s recent history. The COVID-19 outbreak and slow recovery in global economic activity, alongside prolonged financial market turmoil, poses risks to Cambodia’s growth outlook. According to official estimates, the poverty rate in 2014 was 13.5% compared to 47.8% in 2007. About 90% of the poor live in the countryside. While Cambodia achieved in 2009 the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty, the vast majority of families who escaped poverty did so by a small margin. Around 4.5 million people remain near-poor, vulnerable to falling back into poverty when exposed to economic and other external shocks. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty in 2020 could increase among households involved in key sectors like tourism, construction, trade, manufacturing and the garment industry.  Health and education, especially quality, remain important challenges and development priorities.Cambodia has made considerable strides in improving maternal and child health, early childhood development, and primary education in rural areas.

        The World Bank’s engagement in Cambodia focuses on its mandate to eliminate poverty and boost shared prosperity by investing in human capital, tackling rural poverty, building basic infrastructure, and empowering communities.Cambodia received its first credit from the World Bank in 1993. Following decades of conflict, the World Bank’s priority areas were to support the reconstruction of social and economic institutions and the development of physical infrastructure. In subsequent partnership programs, increasing focus has been placed on governance reforms, macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth, livelihoods support, and improving and expanding health and education services. Across the program, the Bank supports citizens’ engagement, particularly to enhance government transparency and accountability.Following the Cambodia Country Engagement Note, which was discussed  by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in May 2016, the World Bank Group conducted a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) to identify challenges and priority development areas to achieve strong, inclusive and sustainable growth and shared prosperity in Cambodia.Drawing from the analysis and broad consultations with civil society, academia and development partners, the SCD identified three pathways for development:Enhancing export competitiveness and economic diversification to sustain strong growth and create jobsBuilding human assets to facilitate economic mobility and shared prosperityEnsuring a more sustainable growth pattern by investing in natural capital, climate resilience, and sustainable urban developmentThe World Bank Group’s new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Cambodia for FY19 – 23 was discussed by the Board on May 30, 2019. This five-year strategy is closely aligned with the fourth phase of Cambodia’s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency. The three focus areas of the CPF are to:  promote state efficiency and boost private sector development, foster human development, and improve agricultural productivity and the sustainable use of natural resources. The Cambodia CPF three focus areas are underpinned by specific objectives:The first focus area—promoting state efficiency and boosting private sector development—includes three objectives:Enhancing financial sector development and fostering private enterprises;Strengthening public sector accountability and public financial management; andExpanding and improving sustainable infrastructure.The second focus area—fostering human development—includes two objectives:Enhancing quality of education and alignment with labor demands; andExpanding access to quality early childhood services, along with health care and nutrition services.The third focus area—improving agricultural productivity and strengthening the sustainable use of natural resources—includes two objectives:Strengthening management of water and land resources; andImproving agricultural productivity and diversification.The critical cross-cutting theme - strengthening governance, institutions and citizen engagement - underpins the strategy and is embedded in all World Bank Group-financed activities.The World Bank supports these focus areas through investment projects in education, health and nutrition, roads, improved livelihoods, agriculture diversification, water supply and sanitation, landscape and water resource management, disaster risk management, and community-level service delivery.The knowledge agenda is a significant part of the World Bank’s engagement in Cambodia. Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) on Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship, Economic Diversification, Digital Development,  Social Accountability, Public Sector Performance, Urbanization, Equitable Access to Quality Health and Nutrition services, Environmental Sustainability and Resilience, and Jobs continue to strengthen the understanding of development challenges Cambodia faces and foster dialogue on development policy issues with a broad range of stakeholders.The World Bank supports Cambodia to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and to strengthen the country’s economy for recovery and future resilience. To that end, the Bank is supporting a multi-pronged approach to preventing and mitigating the health impacts as well as strengthening the systems for pandemic emergency response.

The Secondary Education Improvement Project (SEIP) aims to improve secondary education quality by strengthening school-based management; upgrading the qualification of lower secondary school teachers, school leaders, and educational staff; and improving school facilities through the construction and rehabilitation of 100 existing schools and construction of 30 new schools and equipping laboratory facilities at 100 targeted schools. Over the past three and a half years, the project has benefitted 25,865 students, teachers, and educational staff at national and sub-national levels. The Higher Education Quality and Capacity Improvement Project, completed in September 2017, provided scholarships to around 1,000 students to pursue their tertiary education locally and 64 public and private university professors/staff to continue their studies overseas. The project also supported 78 overseas and 254 local training programs for more than 10,000 higher education leaders, managers and lecturers to improve the quality and relevance of Cambodia's higher education. In addition, 45 research grants were awarded to researchers to set up and conduct their research activities. The ongoing Higher Education Improvement Project (HEIP) is working to improve the quality of teaching and learning of five public higher education institutions (HEIs) by improving the curriculum, teaching pedagogy, staff qualifications, teaching and learning facilities, and promoting the linkages with industry to ensure consistency with the job market. The project also provides grants to promote the development and implementation of research projects in STEM and agriculture.The Health Equity and Quality Improvement Project (H-EQIP) is working to improve the equity and quality of health care services throughout Cambodia. H-EQIP is the fourth in a series of World Bank-supported health projects that have helped to expand the health facility network, supplied medical and laboratory equipment, supported equity and financial protection for the poor, supported for establishment of non-communicable disease services and institutionalize and strengthening government capacity and ownership, enhancing quality of care, including improving infection prevention and control,  and provided better sanitation and water quality in health facilities.The Health Equity Fund (HEF) system, part of H-EQIP, now co-finances free access to almost 2.9 cases, including 2.58 million outpatient visits, approximately 159,000 hospital admissions, over 76,000 emergency care cases and 37,500 cases of delivery per year for the poorest people in Cambodia, nationwide and across all public health facilities in the country. Payments for these services, as well as performance-based grants granted for improving quality of healthcare service delivery are disbursed electronically and in a timely manner into health facilities’ bank accounts. This has changed the empowerment and accountability paradigm, where additional resource availability has facilitated facility-level decision-making. The HEF system has also ensured vital funding for maintaining equipment and infrastructure and for dealing with unexpected shortages of drugs and consumables. Through the Voice and Action Project, the World Bank and other development partners are supporting NGOs to improve the quality of service delivery by Commune Councils, Health Centers, and primary schools. The Implementation Plan for Social Accountability (ISAF) currently covers 75% of Cambodia’s provinces, 62% of districts and 56% of communes. ISAF covers 572 out of 1,191 health centers across the country and 1,422 out of Cambodia’s 7,000 primary schools. It also hires more than 3,650 Community Accountability Facilitators to help mobilize their communities to learn about public services, provide feedback to service providers, and take action to improve service quality. By the end of 2017, more than 11,280 Joint Accountability Action Plans (JAAPs) were developed by service providers and community members and 64% of JAAPs’ activities have been implemented to improve public service delivery.In the water supply and sanitation sector, the Bank-financed Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project is supporting investment in water supply in lagging areas in five provinces and in improving wastewater collection and management in Siem Reap city.In the water resources management sector, the World Bank-supported Mekong Integrated Water Resource Management Project has supported the government in establishing the key foundation for effective water resources and fishery management. So far, 70 community fisheries have been established, 100 engine boats and related equipment have been distributed to Community Fisheries, and 330 out of 500 poor families have received a small grant to help diversify their sources of livelihoods.  In addition, with approximately 50 river guard offices and more than 60 demarcations constructed, the Communities Fisheries have completed facilities and resources to prevent illegal fishing. The project has also established hydrological and meteorological monitoring stations, developed water resource modeling and river basin profiles, and constructed water resources monitoring facilities. Over the past 20 years, the World Bank has helped modernize the transport sector in Cambodia. Between 1999 and 2014, the World Bank financed three road projects including Road Rehabilitation Project (1999-2006), Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project (2003-2011), and Road Asset Management Project (2008-2014), which helped improve and rehabilitate critical road infrastructure across the country.More recently, the ongoing Road Asset Management Project II (RAMPII) has been supporting MPWT to improve condition, safety, and climate resilience of over 420 kilometers (km) of  the core national road network – including sections of NR3, NR4, and NR7 – and to introduce a road management system for the core national road network. Performance-based contracting for road construction and maintenance is expanding to promote private sector participation in road maintenance and to optimize maintenance service quality.The recently approved Road Connectivity Improvement Project will support MPWT and MRD to improve climate resilient road access to key economic and human development facilities including markets, schools and hospitals and benefit over 2 million people in the project area. The technical assistance grants in the transport sector provide analytical and advisory support to government counterparts on private sector participation in the road sector, climate resilience rural road accessibility, road safety and green mobility solutions.In agriculture and infrastructure support, the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development Project (LASED II) has helped to improve access to agricultural resources, infrastructure and social services for many citizens in rural communities. Through the project, the government has allocated 17,000 hectares of residential and agriculture farm land to 5,091 landless and land-poor families. So far, 3,362 families received land titles. Beneficiaries have received basic shelter materials and other in-kind assistance, such as an initial six-month food aid, to help with settling-in process. The project has completed 93 km of earth roads and 91 km of laterite roads on its target sites. It also built schools and health posts, which are accessible both to project beneficiaries and to the wider community. The project also provides improved agriculture extension services, enabling beneficiaries to make the best use of the land and engage in agriculture activities as well as foster more sustainable community development. Access to land for the poor or landless families has been – and continues to be – an important aspect of poverty reduction in Cambodia’s rural areas.The Bank has been actively engaged in supporting public financial management (PFM) and public sector strengthening in Cambodia since 2006 beginning with two successive projects and various technical assistance programs. Completed in 2017, the Public Financial Management Modernization Project (PFMMP) contributed to building an operational Financial Management Information System and improved domestic revenue mobilization capability. Currently, the Bank continues to provide support for improving PFM and service delivery through a programmatic technical assistance program funded by Multi-Donor Trust Fund with contribution from the European Union and Australia under the Cambodia Strengthening PFM and Public Sector Performance for Improved Service Delivery Programmatic Advisory Services and Analytics Project (P168407) 2019-2022. The technical assistance program aims to ease institutional bottleneck for service delivery by focusing not only PFM but also broader public sector reform programs of the government and covering four thematic areas: strengthening budgeting, planning and expenditure management; performance systems for enhanced service delivery; supporting innovation, monitoring, and coordination; and just-in-time support.

        StrategyNumber of Active Projects12IBRD$147.6 MillionIDA $455.5 MillionThe FY18-21 Country Partnership Framework (CPF) supports Moldova’s transition to a new, more sustainable, and inclusive development and growth model through a mix of analytics, advice, financing, and partnerships. The CPF is grounded in the National Development Strategy, takes into account outcomes of the FY14–17 Country Partnership Strategy, and incorporates the three topmost priorities of the Systematic Country Diagnostic, namely:strengthening the rule of law and accountability in economic institutions;improving inclusive access to and the efficiency and quality of public services;enhancing the quality and relevance of education and training for job-relevant skills.These three priorities define and inform the CPF’s three focus areas of economic governance, service governance, and skills development. A mid-term strategy assessment - the Performance and Learning Review - validates these focus areas, with adjustments for the country’s evolving context and priorities, including, but not limited to, building momentum for sound economic governance, maintaining and enhancing progress under service governance, shifting focus toward higher education under the ever-important skills agenda, and mainstreaming climate change across the Bank-supported program.KEY ENGAGEMENTThe World Bank and the International Finance Corporation work together to help Moldova achieve its development goals through improving governance, institutions, and the quality of public services; enhancing the business environment, private sector development, and firm productivity and quality; and deepening investments in human capital, job creation, and infrastructure, including in the energy, information and communications technology (ICT), and transport sectors.As an immediate priority, the Bank is supporting the country’s COVID-19 emergency response and post-crisis recovery and resilience through: (i) new lending projects, (ii) the repurposing of the existing portfolio, and (iii) Advisory Services and Analytics (ASAs). To provide urgently needed support, the Bank approved a €52.5 million Emergency Response Project with a focus on limiting community transmission, building capacity to handle severe cases, and supporting the Government’s social assistance program, particularly targeting the most vulnerable. A US$3.67 million grant was made available from the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility as an additional response to the COVID-19 outbreak.The Bank is repurposing part of the resources in the existing portfolio and ASAs to respond to COVID-19 by: (i) enabling digital access and remote learning and teaching; (ii) supporting economic recovery and longer-term revenue mobilization through sustaining employment and ensuring business survival; and (iii) fast tracking the digitization and reengineering of public services.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsFollowing subdued growth at end-year 2019 that was exacerbated by the outbreak of COVID-19, GDP dropped by 14 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the second quarter of 2020, driven primarily by a contraction in household consumption and investments on the demand side. The current account deficit stood at -8.1 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2020 and -0.8 percent of GDP in the second quarter, mostly financed by debt instruments. On the supply side, the lockdown measures have halted industrial production and trade activities while a severe drought has impacted agriculture.The annual inflation rate remains within the National Bank’s policy range of 5.0 percent ± 1.5. The policy rate was further cut by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75 percent in September 2020, and reserve requirements were reduced to increase credit to the private sector.In July, credit increased by 13.8 percent y-o-y, while the nonperforming loan ratio increased marginally to 8.8 percent. The banking system is well capitalized and liquid. The fiscal stance has deteriorated, and with mounting financing needs, public and publicly guaranteed debt increased by almost 4 percentage points to 33.2 percent of GDP in the first half of 2020. The labor market has been heavily affected, resulting in a 9 percent drop in employment in the same period, y-o-y.Economic Outlook Weaker economic growth in the European Union, combined with the effects of the lockdown, is expected to lead to a significant recession in 2020. Assuming no additional restrictive measures and more favorable external conditions, a slow recovery is envisaged starting in late 2020 or early 2021.In the medium term, growth is expected to stabilize below potential as uncertainty weighs on economic activity. Both the current account and fiscal deficits are projected to remain higher than historical averages. Falling disposable income, the large output gap, and low energy prices, along with moderate appreciation, will outweigh the bad agricultural yields and inflationary pressures. Poverty is expected to increase, and social protection might need to be maintained to minimize any residual effects.With headwinds before the 2020 presidential elections, the 2020 budget plans envisage an ambitious fiscal stimulus, including also a response to COVID-19 that might not be sufficient if downside risks materialize. Domestic risks stem from political instability in the runup to the elections, institutional weaknesses, and political constraints to advancing key reforms. Fragile economic conditions and low productivity levels are exacerbated by the high footprint of the state in the economy, shrinking fiscal space, low financial intermediation, and governance challenges. Additionally, the economy remains vulnerable to extreme weather.

        Lao PDR has made good development progress over the past twenty years, halving poverty, reducing malnutrition and improving education and health outcomes. However, there is room for further improvement. A child born in Laos today will only be half as productive as she could be if she enjoyed full health and education. Malnutrition continues to be a critical issue, with stunting (impaired growth and development from poor nutrition) affecting over 30 percent of children under five. The maternal mortality rate is also high, at 185 per 100,000 births (2017). While a Lao child goes to school for 10.8 years on average, she only receives the equivalent of 6.4 years of learning.The 8th National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016–20 outlines the Lao government’s program for further reducing poverty and boosting prosperity in the country. The plan proposes reforms that support greener, more inclusive growth, recognizing the limitations of a growth model that relies on natural resources and places increasing pressure on the environment. The green growth agenda aims to improve local livelihoods by diversifying income sources and encouraging the private sector to spur market development, for instance through sustainable forest management and nature-based tourism.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed challenges to this agenda. The pandemic has severely affected economic growth, which will decline to an estimated range of between -0.6 to -2.4 percent in 2020. The service sector, including travel and tourism has been hit hard by lockdown measures while remittances, a vital source of income for many families, have dried up. The unemployment rate rose to 25 percent in May 2020, from 16 percent at the end of 2019. Structural vulnerabilities have been exacerbated by COVID-19, leading to a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic situation. State revenues are declining and the fiscal deficit is projected to increase to between 7.6 and 8.9 percent, constraining the government’s ability to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic. Public debt is expected to increase to between 69 and 74 percent in 2020, from around 60 percent in 2019. Foreign currency reserves are low, estimated to cover under one month of imports by the end of 2020. These factors make it increasingly difficult for Laos to meet its debt service obligations, which stand at around US$1.1 billion per year for 2020-23.

        Lao PDR has made good development progress over the past twenty years, halving poverty, reducing malnutrition and improving education and health outcomes. However, there is room for further improvement. A child born in Laos today will only be half as productive as she could be if she enjoyed full health and education. Malnutrition continues to be a critical issue, with stunting (impaired growth and development from poor nutrition) affecting over 30 percent of children under five. The maternal mortality rate is also high, at 185 per 100,000 births (2017). While a Lao child goes to school for 10.8 years on average, she only receives the equivalent of 6.4 years of learning.The 8th National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016–20 outlines the Lao government’s program for further reducing poverty and boosting prosperity in the country. The plan proposes reforms that support greener, more inclusive growth, recognizing the limitations of a growth model that relies on natural resources and places increasing pressure on the environment. The green growth agenda aims to improve local livelihoods by diversifying income sources and encouraging the private sector to spur market development, for instance through sustainable forest management and nature-based tourism.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed challenges to this agenda. The pandemic has severely affected economic growth, which will decline to an estimated range of between -0.6 to -2.4 percent in 2020. The service sector, including travel and tourism has been hit hard by lockdown measures while remittances, a vital source of income for many families, have dried up.

        The Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF) is a large multi-sector local development project that has been supported with $123.5 million through three phases of IDA financing. The PRF has improved access to basic services for 1.2 million rural people through more than 5,000 community infrastructure projects in the poorest districts of the country. In target villages, access to an improved water source increased by nearly 60 percent, and travel time to the nearest village was reduced an average of 114 minutes in the dry season and about 70 minutes in the wet season. Under the latest World Bank support, the PRF is scaling up production and consumption of nutritious foods as a part of a nutrition convergence approach in four northern provinces (Oudomxay, Phongsaly, Houaphan and Xieng Khouang) where the incidence of child stunting is high. A recent impact evaluation of the PRF’s Road Maintenance Groups found that these groups have significantly increased women’s engagement in paid work. a particularly relevant finding as options are examined for economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic.The Lao PDR COVID-19 Response Project was approved in April 2020 to provide a quick response to the pandemic in Laos by enhancing technical capacity among health professionals at all levels and delivering emergency medical equipment and supplies to all 18 provinces. Over 600 health staff have been trained in infection prevention and control according to health ministry protocols. To address the urgent issue of nutrition the World Bank finances a series of projects under the title “Convergence”, taking a holistic approach towards the reduction of stunting among Lao children. In four northern provinces, projects support government efforts through a multi-sectoral approach to improve water supply and sanitation, health and nutrition, social protection, education, and agriculture. The first phase (2019-24) targets households in the twelve poorest northern districts. By the end of 2020, pregnant women in these districts will start receiving cash transfers intended to supplement their children’s health and nutritional status.At the same time, the Health Governance and Nutrition Development Project is working to improve reproductive health, maternal health, child health and nutrition services. Over the last five years it has benefited around one million women and children across 14 provinces using an innovative approach that links disbursement of funds to improved delivery of basic health services. It also runs a social and behavior-change communication program for caregivers, so that children in high priority districts benefit from improved counselling and follow-up on their growth. The project includes support to strengthen information systems and improve health financing and protection programs, with a view to establishing Universal Health Coverage in Laos.In addition, since April 2014 the Early Childhood Education Project has been helping to improve the coverage and quality of education for 3- to 5-year old children in 11 provinces. This project promotes community-based construction grants for pre-primary classrooms and the establishment of Community Child Development Groups for 3- and 4-year-olds. Results so far show the project has benefited 53,000 children aged 3-5 and achieved significant improvements in enrollment, learning environment, and in both literacy and numeracy, plus a reduction in stunting. A complementary project, Global Partnership for Education II, focuses on improving early literacy by targeting 5-year-olds in pre-primary and kindergarten classes, reaching about 600 children in 88 target districts.To boost the benefits of economic growth more widely, the Bank’s SME Access to Finance Project provides funding for banks that provide long-term credit to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This allows small companies to borrow from commercial banks so that they can expand business activities. Of the approved sub-loans, so far 53% have gone to the trade sector, 33% to services, 8% to industry, and 3% each to agriculture and handicraft businesses. The ratio of female beneficiaries is 59%.The Competitiveness and Trade Project, approved in 2018, supports government efforts to simplify business regulations, facilitate trade, and improve competitiveness. New and existing Lao firms are starting to benefit from lower costs of doing business, easier procedures, and access to funding for business improvements. These reforms also benefit the public by generating job opportunities and stimulating competition, leading to lower prices and increased choice in goods. The project prioritizes reforms that benefit SMEs and women-led enterprises. Such reforms include streamlining of operating licenses and business registration, and easier documentation for import and export. The project Business Assistance Facility helps private enterprises to access business development services, aiming to improve company management and innovation. By July 2020, 61 matching grants had been approved to firms in Laos.Supporting the government’s green growth strategy, the Scaling-Up Participatory Sustainable Forest Management Project is helping to build a solid foundation for the strategically important forest sector in Laos. The project has worked with over 100,000 people, largely from ethnic minorities, in over 650 forest villages. Livelihoods support and casual employment in forest restoration has reduced the deforestation rate in Laos and saved 1.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions. Work on management plans for state production forests and third-party certification of wood products has helped to modernize the sector and to create the new Forestry Law of 2019. Complementing this effort, the Second Lao Environment and Social Project is helping to strengthen environmental management capacity by publicly disclosing air pollution data and environmental and social impact assessments for the first time, and by improving the management of 11 protected areas. The project promotes conservation-friendly livelihoods in 189 villages and is strengthening the capacity to curb the illegal wildlife trade, a critical factor in preventing future pandemics like COVID-19 arising from zoonoses.The Lao Road Sector Project 2, with parallel financing from the Nordic Development Fund, the European Investment Bank and the European Union, is now building on these achievements, and aims to improve climate resilience and strengthen maintenance systems to improve the reliability of road connectivity for 2.2 million people in urban and rural areas.

        Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s poorest and most fragile countries, has a population of about 1.9 million. Guinea-Bissau’s Atlantic Ocean coast is composed of an archipelago, the Bijagos, of more than 100 islands. It borders Senegal to the north and Guinea to the south and east, and despite its size, is host to a large variety of ethnic groups, languages, and religions.Political ContextGuinea-Bissau has a history of political and institutional fragility dating back to its independence from Portugal in 1974. The country is one of the most coup-prone and politically unstable countries in the world. Since independence, four successful coups have been recorded in Guinea-Bissau, with another 16 coups attempted, plotted, or alleged.  Held in December 2019, the last Presidential elections were followed by a political crisis, as the defeated candidate, Domingos Simões Pereira, alleging existence of fraud and irregularities, filed a motion to challenge the election results which decision by the Supreme Court is still pending. In April 2020, ECOWAS, followed by the European Union, recognized the election of Umaro Sissoco Embalo as President of the Republic and called for the appointment of a new Prime Minister and government  based on the results of the legislative elections of March 10, 2019. Outcomes of these legislatives elections indicate a configuration of the political picture, with no absolute majority. However, after the Parliamentary session held on June 29, 2020 a new majority seems to be in place after the approval of the de facto Government’s program. Economic Overview·        Growth reached 4.6% (2.2%in per capita terms), from 3.8% in 2018. The recovery was supported by higher cashew output and higher electricity production due to newly installed power generation capacity. However, growth remained below the potential rate of 5% as pre-election political uncertainty weighed on economic activity. The negative output gap exerted a downward pressure on inflation, which remained low at 0.5%. The overall fiscal deficit increased from 4.8% of GDP in 2018 to 5% in 2019, mainly owing to higher recurrent spending. Tax revenue increased marginally from 8.8% of GDP in 2018 to 9.1% in 2019, due to the pickup in economic activity. However, this was largely offset by weaknesses in customs and non-tax revenue. On the expenditure side, total government spending increased from 19.5% of GDP in 2018 to 23% in 2019.·        Growth is projected to decline to -1.5% (-3.8% in per capita terms) in 2020, as lockdown put in place since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic weighs on domestic demand and global cashew demand and price decline. Domestic consumption and investment would be severely affected by the lockdown. Higher public spending to support people and firms affected by the crisis, largely financed by external sources, would help prevent a sharper growth contraction. Inflation is projected to rise from 0.5% in 2019 to 1.1% in 2020, mainly reflecting pressures on food prices caused by negative global supply disruption effects and amplified by local supply shocks.The outlook is subject to substantial downside risks. Renewed political instability could cause fiscal slippages and exacerbate the already difficult business environment. Substantially lower cashew prices or quantities exported would also pose a risk given the high export concentration in cashew. The persistence of the COVID-19 crisis could adversely affect household income and increases their risk of falling into poverty. Risks associated with banking instability also remain a threat to macro-financial stability.A steep increase in oil prices would also put pressure on the external current account balance and leave less resources for pro-poor government spending. Addressing high inequality in the country also requires efforts to improve service delivery and enhance access to basic services. However, accelerating or even sustaining the pace of poverty reduction will be difficult if the political situation remains unresolved, and if the major development challenges that constrain growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability are not addressed.

Domestic consumption and investment would be severely affected by the lockdown. Higher public spending to support people and firms affected by the crisis, largely financed by external sources, would help prevent a sharper growth contraction. Inflation is projected to rise from 0.5% in 2019 to 1.1% in 2020, mainly reflecting pressures on food prices caused by negative global supply disruption effects and amplified by local supply shocks.The outlook is subject to substantial downside risks. Renewed political instability could cause fiscal slippages and exacerbate the already difficult business environment. Substantially lower cashew prices or quantities exported would also pose a risk given the high export concentration in cashew. The persistence of the COVID-19 crisis could adversely affect household income and increases their risk of falling into poverty. Risks associated with banking instability also remain a threat to macro-financial stability.A steep increase in oil prices would also put pressure on the external current account balance and leave less resources for pro-poor government spending. Addressing high inequality in the country also requires efforts to improve service delivery and enhance access to basic services. However, accelerating or even sustaining the pace of poverty reduction will be difficult if the political situation remains unresolved, and if the major development challenges that constrain growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability are not addressed.

        Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s poorest and most fragile countries, has a population of about 1.9 million. Guinea-Bissau’s Atlantic Ocean coast is composed of an archipelago, the Bijagos, of more than 100 islands. It borders Senegal to the north and Guinea to the south and east, and despite its size, is host to a large variety of ethnic groups, languages, and religions.Political ContextGuinea-Bissau has a history of political and institutional fragility dating back to its independence from Portugal in 1974. The country is one of the most coup-prone and politically unstable countries in the world. Since independence, four successful coups have been recorded in Guinea-Bissau, with another 16 coups attempted, plotted, or alleged.  Held in December 2019, the last Presidential elections were followed by a political crisis, as the defeated candidate, Domingos Simões Pereira, alleging existence of fraud and irregularities, filed a motion to challenge the election results which decision by the Supreme Court is still pending. In April 2020, ECOWAS, followed by the European Union, recognized the election of Umaro Sissoco Embalo as President of the Republic and called for the appointment of a new Prime Minister and government  based on the results of the legislative elections of March 10, 2019.

        Côte d’Ivoire, Francophone West Africa’s economic hub, is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and remains the globe’s leading producer and exporter of cocoa beans and cashew nuts.Despite recent efforts, Côte d’Ivoire has a low human capital index score (0.35) according to World Bank rankings, and still has one of the highest gender inequality rates in the world. The country should target the most vulnerable segments of the population for greater redistribution of the benefits reaped from its sound economic performance, further integrate women into the economy, and develop its human capital to better meet the needs of the labor market.  The production of modern goods and services requires skills that are still lacking in the local labor force.Political ContextCôte d’Ivoire is headed toward presidential elections slated for October 31, 2020 to select the successor to President Alassane Ouattara, who opted not to run again after serving two consecutive five-year terms. The two main opposition leaders, Henri Konan Bédié and former president Laurent Gbagbo, have not yet declared their intention to run for the presidency.Laurent Gbagbo was acquitted by the International Criminal Court, but granted conditional release pending appeal proceedings. Upon completion of these proceedings, he could join the presidential race.In addition, the constitution and electoral code were revised and adopted in late March 2020 by both houses of Parliament and enacted by President Ouattara. The opposition, which called for a referendum to amend the constitution, is still contesting the legitimacy of the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI), which has been tasked with organizing the upcoming elections. The Parti Démocratique de Côte d’Ivoire (PDCI) led by Henri Konan Bédié and the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI) headed by Laurent Gbagbo, as well as parties close to the former speaker of the National Assembly, Guillaume Soro, did not participate in the discussions that led to the setting up of the CEI.This disagreement, as well as disputes surrounding the issuance of new ID cards that will also serve as voter cards for the first time in the country, are raising fears of renewed political tensions as presidential elections approach.Economic SituationPrior to the global shock triggered by the coronavirus pandemic,  Côte d’Ivoire still had one of the most robust growth rates in Africa and in the world. The economy, which had grown at an average annual rate of 8% since 2012, had been projected to grow by 7% in 2020. However, the global health situation has had a major impact on Ivorian households and businesses, and economic growth for 2020—originally projected to be 7%—is now expected to slow to around 1.8%.While the construction sector was one of the main drivers of growth in 2019, the gradual diversification of the economy and the vibrant private sector are expected to fuel growth in 2020.The proximity of the presidential elections, which are scheduled for October 2020, and the health crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic may create uncertainty and have a negative impact on private investment.  Last Updated: Oct 02, 2020","

        In January 2019, the government launched a social program (Psgouv 2019-2020) with a budget of over CFAF 1 trillion ($1.72 billion) to promote more inclusive redistribution of economic growth.The objectives of this program include providing lower-cost water and electricity services to the most underserved communities and increasing school access and retention of children.   It is expected to ultimately improve the living conditions of the poorest households and thus reduce the incidence of poverty.World Bank Group engagement in Côte d'Ivoire  (IDA, IFC, and MIGA) is guided by a Country Partnership Framework  for the 2016-2020 period. This framework, which seeks to accelerate and scale up WBG engagement in the country, focuses on three priorities:Promoting more rapid and sustainable private sector-led growth;Building the human capital essential for economic development and social cohesion;Strengthening public finance management, transparency, and institutional accountability.Furthermore, the activities linked to these priority areas must integrate two cross-cutting issues: governance and spatial inequalities.The World Bank Group is currently financing 32 national projects and 4 regional projects valued at a total of $3.13 billion and covering several areas:Improving rural land tenure, developing the competitiveness of the cashew industry (cashew nuts), the digital economy, urban mobility, and infrastructure;Combating coastal erosion, promoting transparency of information in the extractive industries, and improving forest resource management;Establishing personal identification systems;Strengthening the education and health sectors, as well as support for child development and nutrition.The CPF mid-term review was done in order to assess the progress made and draw lessons from its implementation.  Following this assessment, the World Bank recentered its priorities around human capital development and social inclusion.  It also implemented a new approach aimed at maximizing financing for development through the mobilization of private sector investment.  The CPF was extended to FY 2021, in order to align it with the electoral cycle and the National Development Plan (2016-20).COVID-19 response: On May 5, 2020, the World Bank provided $35 million in emergency financing to help Côte d’Ivoire respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.International Finance Corporation (IFC)IFC, the WBG institution focused on private sector development, has played a seminal role in Côte d’Ivoire since the end of the post-electoral crisis in 2011. Between 2010 and 2019, IFC invested more than 1 billion in own-account resources and third-party funds to boost the generation capacity of two power plants (AZITO and CIPREL) by 350 MW. IFC supported the construction of these facilities a few years ago.IFC has also invested in banks and financial institutions, enabling them to expand their services to serve small and medium enterprises and provide mortgage loans.  In addition, IFC has promoted several business environment reforms that lifted Côte d’Ivoire into the ranks of the top 10 performing countries in the area of the business environment as measured in the Doing Business report. Since 2015 and the beginning of current CPF implementation, IFC has engaged in over 10 investment transactions and a similar number of advisory operations.Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)MIGA has three active projects in Côte d’Ivoire with a total exposure of $659.4 million in critical oil and gas and infrastructure activities. This makes Cote d’Ivoire one of MIGA’s highest-exposure countries,  guaranteeing coverage of risks of transfer restriction and currency inconvertibility, expropriation, breach of contract, and war and civil disturbance. MIGA’s exposure is in support of the CI-27 gas field expansion, the Henry Konan Bédié Bridge in Marcory, and an upgrade of the Azito thermal power plant.  MIGA is also working on other potential projects, including a hospital PPP, a wastewater treatment plan, and a biomass IPP project.  In addition, the government has asked it to explore support for the health and roads sectors.

        The Republic of Korea has achieved remarkable success in combining rapid economic growth with significant poverty reduction. The government of Korea’s policies resulted in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.3% annually between 1960 and 2019.

        The Republic of Korea became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in 1955 and joined the .  International Development Association (IDA) in 1961.  The Bank began its operations in Korea in 1962 when it completed the first Country Economic Report and approved an IDA credit of US$17 million to expand and improve the Korean National Railroad.By 1973, Korea’s economy had progressed sufficiently to require no further IDA assistance. The Bank then supported Korea through low-interest loans, policy advice, and technical assistance from IBRD. Over the years, from IDA and IBRD, the Bank completed 133 credit or loan projects in Korea, disbursing funds totaling US$15 billion.The Bank’s work in Korea evolved to match the country’s changing needs. In the early years, the Bank focused on lending for agriculture, irrigation, rural development, small and medium industry, transportation (such as roads, ports, and railways), regional and urban development, and education. Investment in agriculture increased substantially in the 1970s, and then declined in the 1980s as the economy shifted to a greater emphasis on industrial development. Priorities on human capital accumulation evolved as the economy demanded more skilled labor and research and development (R&D) for science and technology.Later, social infrastructure – such as urban water supply, sanitation, and sewerage – and its environmental impact became a high priority as the country’s industrial sector and its energy and transportation infrastructure became more developed. During this period, heavy emphasis was placed on achieving greater social equity through a fair distribution of income and wealth.During the financial crisis of the late 1990s, the World Bank supported the government of Korea’s reform programs through a series of adjustment loans, worth a total of US$7 billion. These programs ranged from financial sector restructuring to reforms in corporate sector and labor market reforms as well as in social safety nets. The reforms helped make the country’s economic model more sustainable and resilient to economic downturns.The World Bank Group hosts a range of partnerships and joint projects with Korean partners to help developing countries enhance financial sector management; promote investment in green growth innovation – in energy, the environment, and urban development/land management; share know-how in information communication technology; and assist fragile and conflict-affected states.For example, the Korea-World Bank Partnership Facility, launched in 2012, provides US$90 million over three years and a replenishment of US$140 million from FY20 through FY23 to finance global and regional projects that support economic development and co-financing investments at the country level. The emphasis is on generating and transferring development best practices, with low and lower middle-income countries eligible for funding under the new facility.In December 2013, the World Bank Group opened a new main office in Songdo, Incheon and a liaison office in Seoul. From 2014 to 2018, the offices supported a broad range of development partnership opportunities with a focus on promoting best practices. This was achieved by leveraging the Bank Group’s knowledge and convening power as well as Korea’s expertise in areas such as green growth, financial innovation, private sector development, and technology and innovation.The Korea office continues to expand and provide innovative and technology-based solutions for sustainable development by expanding the green innovation program with a greater emphasis on supporting the operational work across sectors. For example, the green growth innovation program, jointly with the Korea Green Growth Trust Fund (KGGTF), built an operational and analytical program to support the green growth agenda in developing countries.In April 2018, the World Bank and the government of Korea agreed to a three-year extension of the World Bank Group Korea Office Trust Fund Agreement. While continuing to solidify the knowledge partnership, the Korea office has expanded its operational support on innovation and technology and aimed to broaden and strengthen partnerships with the Korean partners. A focus on mobilizing private sector investment will also be pursued through the Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).With continued progress, the World Bank Group Korea office will play a bridging role in facilitating the partnership between Korea and the World Bank Group as well as partners around the world.

        StrategyWORLD BANK PORTFOLIO IN THE KYRGYZ REPUBLICNo. of IDA Projects (country): 15Lending: $502.6 million (IDA)No. of IDA Projects (regional): 5 for $165 millionTrust Funds: $64.61 millionTerms: 50 percent of financing is provided in the form of IDA grants, and 50 percent is highly concessional IDA credits with no interest and a 0.75 percent service charge.  Credits are repayable in 38 years, including a six-year grace period.The World Bank and the Kyrgyz RepublicSince the Kyrgyz Republic joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank’s financial assistance has amounted to over US$2,024 million.World Bank support has helped the country to maintain macroeconomic stability, invest in strategic infrastructure, and improve access to social services. To enhance the impact of the sizable external assistance that the country enjoys and avoid duplication of effort by donors, the World Bank Group, through its convening role, has worked closely with the Government to help improve broader donor coordination in the country and link it more directly to identified national priorities. In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the World Bank has provided emergency support to the Kyrgyz Republic in the amount of US$160.15 million, out of which US$22.15 million was directed to address immediate health needs and US$138 million to help the poor and vulnerable population, as well as businesses, to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.Key EngagementThe strategic focus of the World Bank’s program as highlighted in the 2019–22 Country Partnership Framework is to assist the Kyrgyz Republic in promoting diversified, export-oriented, inclusive, and sustainable private sector–led growth.World Bank engagement for the next several years will be built around three focus areas:First, strengthening the foundations for inclusive private sector–led growth, focusing especially on fiscal stability, improvements to the regulatory environment for business, and risk reduction.Second, boosting overall productivity and building greater connectivity through support for the development of promising natural resource sectors and greater digital and physical connectivity.Third, expanding economic opportunities and building resilience through investments in human capital, efforts to decentralize and support regional development, and better adaptation to environmental and climate risks.Support for these areas will be provided through concessional International Development Association (IDA) lending, supplemented by trust fund financing and intensified Advisory Services and Analytics that emphasize practical, problem-solving advice.Under the Sustainable Development Financing Policy initiative, which seeks to incentivize IDA countries to borrow sustainably, the Kyrgyz Government agreed on Performance and Policy Actions (PPAs) for FY21. Agreed PPAs focus on improved macro-fiscal management.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, real GDP contracted by 5.9 percent in January–August 2020, year-on-year (y-o-y). Major disruptions were in wholesale and retail trade, public catering, consumer services, transportation, and construction. With the border closures, external trade fell by 22 percent in January–June 2020, y-o-y. Hit by much lower remittances and domestic demand, imports in U.S. dollar terms declined by over 30 percent, y-o-y. Exports rose by 2 percent, thanks to higher gold exports.The 12-month rate of inflation peaked at 8.6 percent in April 2020, up from 3.1 percent in December 2019. A sharp depreciation of the national currency, the som, in March was a contributing factor. With the som regaining some of its value since then, inflation moderated to 5 percent by August 2020.Lower revenues and higher expenditures to ameliorate the pandemic led to a deteriorating fiscal position. Revenues fell, compounded by the lockdown. To alleviate the impact, businesses were allowed to postpone tax payments. Expenditures increased owing to additional health and social assistance spending. As a result, the deficit soared to 7.4 percent of GDP in the first half of 2020 from 0.3 percent a year ago, and public debt increased to 62 percent of GDP as of end-June from 54 percent in December 2019.Economic OutlookA baseline scenario projects a decline in real GDP of 5.5 percent in 2020. Growth is forecast to rebound to 4.8 percent in 2021 as domestic activity recovers with the likely availability of a vaccine and as external demand improves. Growth is projected to slow to 4.5 percent in 2022. With the stabilization of the exchange rate, inflation is expected to be within the range of 5–6 percent. The current account deficit is projected to widen to about 12 percent of GDP in 2020, reflecting lower non-gold exports and reduced remittances. However, it is expected to narrow to around 9 percent of GDP in 2021–22.  The fiscal deficit is projected at 7.1 percent of GDP in 2020. Over the medium term, the authorities expect the fiscal deficit to decline to 3 percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation would require measures to expand the tax base, roll back pandemic-related expenditures, and streamline non-priority purchases.Under a downside scenario, which assumes a second wave of the coronavirus in November, real GDP is expected to contract by 8 percent in 2020, with the current account and fiscal deficits deteriorating to around 14 percent and 8 percent of GDP, respectively.

        All ProjectsHighlighted ProjectKyrgyz Republic Emergency COVID-19 ProjectOn April 2, 2020, the Kyrgyz Republic was among the first group of countries to receive World Bank financing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the request of the Government, the World Bank provided US$12.15 million through the Emergency COVID-19 Project.To help prevent the spread of the virus, urgently needed supplies will be procured, including testing kits, laboratory reagents, and personal protective equipment. The country will also acquire 20 fully equipped ambulances, and rapid response groups will receive vehicles specifically for the transfer of equipment and supplies.The project will also procure Intensive Care Unit (ICU) equipment and supplies, which will include mechanical ventilators, cardiac defibrillators, mobile x-rays, oxygen concentrators, and other essential equipment, to establish or renew 10 eight-bed, fully equipped ICUs in designated hospitals. Another 20 ICUs and 100 isolation rooms in 24 hospitals around the country will undergo emergency repairs to ensure patient and staff safety. Project funds will also be used to top up salaries for medical staff and to hire additional staff where necessary.“The purpose of the Emergency COVID-19 Project is to save lives and prevent further contagion.  Investments will focus on immediate health care needs,” says Bolormaa Amgaabazar, World Bank Country Manager for the Kyrgyz Republic.World Bank funding will support the Kyrgyz Republic’s Contingency Plan for COVID-19.

         StrategyNumber of active projects5IBRD net commitments$395 millionThe World Bank conducts research and analysis and provides policy advice and capacity development on topics critical to Russia’s economic and social development at the federal and regional levels. World Bank support focuses on such areas as the investment climate, green finance, health care, education (including early childhood development and skills), social protection, and community-driven development and participatory budgeting. Ongoing projects support the improvement of basic service delivery at the local level, increased financial literacy, and the protection of the environment.Russia is an important development partner for the World Bank Group. The Bank’s partnership with the Russian Government helps bring the country’s knowledge and financial resources to benefit other countries around the world. Since 2007, Russia has pledged US$896 million to the International Development Association (IDA).Russia has also contributed $279 million across 24 World Bank-administered trust funds in support of education, SME development, public financial management, and other development areas in countries across Europe and Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Russia has also pledged $438 million to eight Financial Intermediary Funds that tackle global development challenges, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, debt relief, environmental protection, women’s entrepreneurship, and governance and public institutions in Middle East and North Africa countries in transition. Most recently, Russia pledged $3 million to the Green Climate Fund.KEY ENGAGEMENTThe World Bank’s Advisory Services and Analytics program is organized under two broad themes:Growth and competitiveness, which focuses on macroeconomic and fiscal management, labor market informality, productivity, the investment climate, SME development, trade integration, agriculture, and the digital economyHuman capital, poverty, and shared prosperity, which focuses on education, including early childhood development, integrated health care, and social protectionMany activities are delivered as Reimbursable Advisory Services (RASs). The RAS portfolio includes activities on agriculture, food security,  the investment climate, statistics,  education and skills, social protection, and community-driven development and participatory budgeting.The knowledge program is delivering results. The Local Initiatives Support Program (LISP) has helped boost citizen participation in municipal decision making. Citizens, working together with municipal authorities, identify and prioritize small-scale infrastructure projects that address specific community needs. This has led to the more effective use of local budgets and a more rapid implementation of projects.The LISP started in the region of Stavropol krai 14 years ago. Today, LISP is a national program, covering about one-third of Russia’s 80-plus regions. More than 12,000 participatory projects have been implemented, benefiting over 7.5 million people. On average, 20 percent of all projects has been co-financed from regional business and local community resources.

        Recent Economic DevelopmentsElevated geopolitical risks and fewer restrictions on travel amidst the continued weakness of export receipts resulted in the depreciation of the ruble in August 2020. The average ruble exchange rate depreciated by 3.5 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar. Concerns over the pandemic’s second wave, lower oil prices, and an escalation of geopolitical risks led to stronger pressure for another depreciation in September. In the period from end-August to end-September, the ruble exchange rate depreciated by 5.4 percent against the U.S. dollar.In August, annual headline inflation accelerated to 3.6 percent compared to 3.4 percent in July, though it remains below the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) target of 4 percent. Higher consumer price index inflation was driven by rebounding domestic demand after the lockdown (which was above expectations) and by the weakening of the ruble on the back of the increased volatility in global markets and higher geopolitical risks.In September, the CBR paused its accommodative policy actions, leaving the key policy rate at a record low of 4.25 percent. This historically low policy rate, along with a 13 percent tax on interest from all bank deposits over rub 1 million ($14,000) that will become effective in 2021, stimulated an unprecedented surge in retail investors in the Russian stocks and bonds market.Labor market dynamics deteriorated in August, with unemployment increasing to 6.4 percent, up from 4.5 percent at the beginning of the year. In the second quarter of 2020, real disposable incomes decreased significantly by 8 percent, year-on-year (y-o-y), compared to 1.2 percent growth, y-o-y, in the first quarter.In the first eight months of 2020, the federal budget registered a deficit of rub 1,692 billion compared to a surplus of rub 2,674 billion in the same period last year. This was on the back of higher spending and lower oil/gas revenues.Credit growth has slightly rebounded since the strict lockdown measures were lifted. In July, household lending grew by 1.7 percent, month-on-month (m-o-m), compared to 1 and 0.2 percent, m-o-m, in June and May, respectively. Mortgage lending continues to be the major contributor to household credit growth. > LEARN MORE: Russia Monthly Economic DevelopmentsECONOMIC OUTLOOKThe economy will be in recession in 2020 but is expected to rebound in 2021 and 2022. In 2020, Russia’s GDP is expected to contract by  5 percent, an 11-year low. The agreed OPEC+ production cuts are expected to weigh on growth in 2020 and 2021. GDP is projected to expand by 2.8 and 2.4 percent in 2021 and 2022, respectively, in the baseline scenario (1.0 and 1.2 percent in an adverse scenario). With the fallout from fiscal oil/gas receipts and the relaxation of the fiscal rule in 2021, both the federal and regional budgets are expected to register deficits in 2020-22, largely financed through domestic debt borrowing and proposed tax increases to be borne by metals and oil and gas companies. As of July 1, 2020, the regional budget deficit had reached about 0.2 percent of GDP compared to a roughly 0.6 percent surplus in the same period last year. No subnational crisis, however, is expected, as Russia has reasonably managed aggregate subnational finances.Public debt, currently at 13.9 percent of GDP, could increase to about 24 percent of GDP by 2022, which is still manageable.However, a rebound is not a recovery, particularly given Russia’s significant structural impediments noted earlier. Recovery measures are under way, though the new adverse economic environment has prompted the country to adjust and postpone its national development goals. The new goals will also require changes to the “national projects” that are planned to be finalized by end-October. Although these projects aim to address the structural impediments, their success will likely boil down to three factors: first, how well they are implemented, particularly on the regional level; second, how “additional” they are, i.e., whether they will merely be old wine in new bottles; and finally, whether they can leverage private expertise and money.Risks are firmly tilted to the downside. Downside risks involve a more protracted pandemic and hence a prolongation of containment measures; a slow and shallow global economic recovery; a further drop in commodity prices; growing macro-financial vulnerabilities; and a worsening of geopolitical risks and the triggering of worse-than-anticipated sanctions. If these risks materialize, growth would slacken. For example, a more protracted pandemic would lower growth from 2.7 to 1 percent in 2021 (preliminary estimate).The main upside risk is the development of Sputnik V and Vector anti-COVID-19 vaccines, which, if proven safe and effective, could lead to mass vaccinations and hence accelerate growth in 2021–22. Currently, the vaccines are at the start of third-stage trials, with results expected by end-October (according to Russian authorities).> LEARN MORE: Russia Economic Reports
