The centre will also monitor goods and services, and strict measures have also been taken to control product prices and supplies.  On the 4th of April, legislation was passed to recognise COVID 19 as a state of emergency, and it is expected that this will lead to an increase in spending. On March 12, 2020, the World Bank provided a grant of $3.7 million to strengthen prevention against the COVID-19 pandemic, purchase materials and equipment, and train health workers.","","","","","","","","","","","Click here","True","","","","","","True","","","True","True","","","True","","True","","True","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",NA,NA,6.6,6.6,7.8,3.2,7,8.9,6.4,6.2,8.3,5.8,9.2,4.2,5.9,-1.5,7.5531914893617,6.66666666666667,6.1,6.73400673400673,0.00130038745,7.79324520805473,1.867,2.64974216580722,19,8,30.9166666666667,10.5277777777778,11,-11.9166666666667,8.47222222222222,137.5,-38.544474393531,80.4749340369393,33,8,26.5,9.05555555555556,25,6.5,23.9444444444444,312.5,24.5283018867925,264.41717791411,4.58333333333333,0,1.34124890061566,7.8125,0.613207547169811,3.30521472392638,4,4,4,0,0.5,8,4.3,4,3.2,3.6,8.03001876172608,3.9,4.6,4.8,-1.2,4,-6,"4.8","0.4","5",-4.4,6.09833465503569,4.15384615384615,"Madagascar","2020-09-10",3.44434782608696,0,0,1.2,1,0,1,-0.752976274850019,8.1897793745921,37.7,37.7,"Hot","Dry","",1,3,NA,7.2,7.4,4.4,0,5.1,36.72,37.74,22.44,0,"0",0,37.74,22.44,0,0,37.74,33.66,0,5.02968447735308,6.43081761006289,"","","","",NA,"Southern Africa Regional Food Security Crisis","REG012","Regional crisis",3.7,3,0,3.8,3.5,5.699430879,NA,0.5,NA,0.5,5.5,3.7,7.5,7.4,0,0,4.8,5.1,0.7,2.9,3.9,7.6,9.7,7.8,8.4,5.6,2.8,3,0.6,22.9,8.6,4.5,1.4,7,4.3,5.3,4.7,4.3,5.625,0,0.2

Support will be given to citizens who lose their jobs, as well as suspending social security contributions for all citizens. The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Administration Reform announced there would be increased financing for SMEs, which will enable financing resources for companies whose cash flow has deteriorated due to COVID. This policy covers 95% of the amount of the loan and thus allows banks to quickly set up exceptional overdrafts to finance the working capital needs of the concerned enterprises. The interministerial Committee has been intensely monitoring the price of goods and services, particularly food, and has warned of sanctions against fraud and price speculation.
