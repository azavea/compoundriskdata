        <p>The attack on Tripoli in early 2019 and the blockade of Libya's major oil ports and terminals in January 2020 have together caused the most serious political, economic, and humanitarian crises Libya has faced since 2011.<b> </b>Libya's economy was already slowing in 2019 with real GDP growth falling sharply to 2.5% from what seemed a promisingly steady recovery with record growth of 20.8% (on average) in 2017–2018. But, as military confrontation escalated in 2019/2020, oil production decreased—from 1.2 million bpd in December 2019 to 0.1 million bpd in April 2020—choking the country's economic lifeline.</p>
<p>The Libyan economy has now been hit by four, overlapping shocks: an intensifying conflict, which suffocates economic activity; the closure of oil fields, which puts its major income-generating activity largely on hold; decreasing oil prices, which reduce income from surviving oil fields; and the COVID-19 pandemic, which further threatens the economy, with almost 3,500 cases and 75 deaths confirmed by August 2020.  </p>
<p><b>Current Account and Foreign Exchange</b></p>
<p>In 2019, Libya's current account continued to register surpluses for the third year in a row, largely due to the Central Bank of Libya's (CBL's) rationing its supply of hard currency for essential imports only, although higher hydrocarbon revenues also contributed to the surplus. Despite this surplus, by the end of 2019, foreign reserves had declined, and the dramatic drop seen since 2014 in foreign direct investments to Libya had also contributed to pressure on foreign reserves. Libya needs political resolution before economic reforms can be implemented to initiate private sector-driven growth and the generation of new jobs—the country's only path toward sustainable, shared prosperity.</p>
<p>In the absence of improvement on the ground, the economic downturn will deepen. Libya's inability, or curtailed capacity, to produce and export oil might well continue for the rest of 2020 because of the closure of its oil ports and terminals—it is expected to produce a daily average of only 0.17 million barrels of oil for 2020, less than one-seventh of 2019's production. As a result, GDP is expected to shrink by 41% in 2020. The 2020 budget partially reflects this dire situation with a large, forecasted deficit, the highest in recent years. Likewise, the government's current account is expected to run astronomical deficits in 2020; consequently, reserves will be further depleted.</p>
<p>Given the extreme volatility and unpredictability surrounding recent economic trends, it is not easy to forecast beyond the immediate future. After years of high inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) declined in 2019 as the exchange rate on the parallel market decreased. CPI fell by 2.2% over 2019, compared to a high average of 21.6% inflation over 2016–2018. Inflation picked up in the first two quarters of 2020, reaching 1.3% by April, as the conflict intensified, and shortages too.</p>
<p>Libya's currency continues to suffer on the parallel market because of political uncertainty and macroeconomic instability<b>.</b> The official exchange rate of the Libyan dinar (LYD) against the US dollar stood at 1.37 LYD to US$1 in August 2020, having depreciated by 1.1% compared to August 2018.</p>
<p>The parallel exchange market often diverges from official rates but the introduction of the forex fee, while easing access to foreign exchange—especially for essential imports and family allowances—has allowed the steady convergence of the parallel and official, taxed exchange rates, bringing parallel market rates down from LYD/US$9.2 in 2017 to LYD/US$4.0 in 2019. The forex fee was reduced to 163% in August 2019, as the parallel exchange rate moved closer to the official, taxed exchange rate. Prompted by weak macroeconomic fundamentals, the lack of oil exports and decline of global oil prices, and restrictions on the sale of foreign currency imposed by the CBL, the Libyan dinar lost 54% of its value on the parallel market in the first half of 2020, reaching LYD/ US$6.17 in September 2020.</p>
<p><b>Libya Public Finance</b></p>
<p>The 2020 budget shows a huge deficit, due to high, rigid expenditure in a context of domestic and global health and economic crises, resulting in shocks to oil supply and demand. On March 20, the GNA adopted a budget for 2020 with an underlying deficit of LYD 29.2 billion (19.3 billion for Tripoli and 9.9 billion for Beyda), representing 90.6% of GDP, the country's highest deficit ever. The budget estimated LYD 19.2 billion in total revenue for 2020 (59.5% of GDP), almost a third of last year's share. Only LYD 6 billion is expected to come from the proceeds of oil, less than fifth of what they were in 2019. Projections for non-oil revenue (LYD 3.2 billion) seem overly optimistic given the dire political, social, and economic context and weak administration of customs and tax revenues. Public finances are expected to improve slightly but the inflexibility of current expenditure and volatility of oil revenue place the country's overall fiscal stance under severe stress.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Sudan is geographically located at the crossroads of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle-East and stretches across the Red Sea. Sudan shares borders with seven countries including Libya and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"" title=""Egypt"">Egypt</a> to the North, Chad to the West, the Central African Republic to the South-West, South Sudan to the South, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"" title=""Ethiopia"">Ethiopia</a> to the South-East and Eritrea to the East. </p>
<p>The White and Blue Niles meet in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, and merge to become the Nile River that flows all the way to the Mediterranean Sea via Egypt. Sudan has a Sahelian belt with the desert in the far north,  fertile land in the Nile valleys, the Gezira and across the rest of the country from Darfur to Kassala via Blue Nile and Kordofan States for farming and livestock herding.</p>
<p>For most of its independent history, the country has been beset by internal conflicts that weakened its ability to play a leadership role in the region. Under the terms of a comprehensive peace agreement in 2005, South Sudan seceded in 2011 and became the 54<sup>th</sup> independent State of Africa.</p>
<p>The secession of South Sudan induced multiple economic shocks. The biggest one being the loss of the oil revenue that accounted for more than half of Sudan's government revenue and 95% of its exports. This has reduced economic growth, and resulted in double-digit consumer price inflation, which, together with increased fuel prices, triggered violent protests in September 2013.</p>
<p>The outbreak of civil war in South Sudan damaged both economies depriving Sudan of much needed pipeline revenues. The war in South Sudan also precipitated an increase in Sudan's already large population of refugees and internally displaced persons with Sudan now serving as a source, destination and transit country for irregular migration, including refugees and asylum-seekers using the East African North-bound migratory route through Libya to Europe. The country hosts an estimated 763 thousand South Sudanese refugees and 159 thousand refugees and asylum seekers from Eritrea, Syria, Yemen, and Chad. The recent peace accord between the warring parties brokered by Sudan and Ethiopia appears to be holding, but the war damaged oil infrastructure, further eroding revenue availability to Sudan.</p>
<p>Following the global oil price slump in 2015/2016, Sudan and South Sudan agreed to lower oil transit fees for South Sudanese oil via Sudan's pipeline, as it became inefficient to export it. In December 2016, they extended their 2012 agreement on oil for three years on the same terms, except for provisions to adjust transit fees in line with global oil prices.   </p>
<p>Continuous food price hikes led to the December 2018 demonstrations which resulted in the removal of president El-Bashir from power in April 2019. This led to the formation of a Transition Government in September 2019. The power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian forces expected to last 39 months, allowed a civilian Prime Minister to lead the government under the authority of a Presidential Sovereign Council to be chaired by the military during the first 21 months followed by a civilian during the remaining 18 months. A transitional legislative assembly is expected to be established soon. On Wednesday July 22, 2020 the Prime Minister appointed 18 civilian Governors thereby achieving a key milestone included in the Constitutional Document of the transition.</p>
<p>Armed conflicts in Sudan's westernmost region of Darfur have subsided but many parts of the region remain precarious because of the proliferation of arms and banditry. Efforts to settle conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile remain deadlocked. The Transitional Government has  engaged in peace negotiations with relevant armed groups and signed a peace deal in October 3, 2020 with Sudan Revolution Front (SRF)   expected to put an end to the long-standing conflicts that divert huge resources from much needed social programs and investments in human capital to military buildup.     </p>
<p>In addition to the political and economic uncertainty, Sudan, like the rest of the world, has been experiencing the unprecedented social and economic impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The COVID-19 shock is expected to be transitory with potential recovery possible in 2021 but the overall adverse economic impact on Sudan will be substantial. The economic impact of COVID-19 includes the increased price of basic foods, rising unemployment, and falling exports. Restrictions on movement are making the economic situation worse, with commodity prices soaring across the country. According to the International Monetary Fund has already forecasted an overall economic stagnation in 2020 in Sudan. </p>

        <p><b>Country Context</b></p>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 has hit Afghanistan in the midst of a difficult political transition, an intensifying conflict, and significant uncertainty regarding future grant support. Afghanistan's economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2019, driven mainly by strong agricultural growth following recovery from drought. The economy is estimated to have contracted sharply over the first half of 2020, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Wheat production (mostly in the subsistence sector) has supported continued agricultural growth, but industry and service output have been heavily impacted by lockdowns and border closures.</li>
<li>A power-sharing agreement has been signed between the two parties contesting the outcome of the September 2019 presidential elections. Implementation is now underway, that has led to changes in senior staff across key ministries. While the peace talks between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban has started on 12 September 2020, Taliban attacks on Afghan security forces have intensified. The future of international assistance remains in question. The US has substantially reduced troop numbers over 2020, with further reductions likely. Current grant pledges expire at the end of 2020, and international partners are due to consider future aid commitments at an international conference in November. Without progress towards a sustainable peace and commitments to continued grant support from international partners, medium-term prospects appear increasingly grim. Civilian causalities remain high with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan recording 10,392civilian casualties in 2019, and 462,803 Afghans internally displaced due to conflict. The surge in returns by an estimated 1.7 million documented and undocumented Afghan refugees during 2016-2017 remains a pressure on the country's economy and institutions. Internal displacement and large-scale return within a difficult economic and security context pose risks to welfare for the displaced and host communities.</li>
<li>As the international community's financial commitment to Afghanistan at the October 2016 Brussels Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan is due to expire by the end of 2020, a new pledging conference is planned to be held at the ministerial level in November 2020 hosted by Finland. World Bank Group engagement pursues a programmatic approach to support the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework (ANPDF) that was presented by the Government of Afghanistan at the Brussels Conference. Advisory work and operations focus on macro-fiscal policy and management; finance, private investments and jobs creation; public sector governance and anti-corruption; human capital development and service delivery; citizen engagement and social inclusion, urban development; and infrastructure, connectivity and sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recent Economic Developments</b></p>
<p>Substantial improvements in development outcomes have been observed in Afghanistan since 2001, particularly in expanded access to water, sanitation and electricity, education, and health services. Macroeconomic management remains strong, government revenues have grown consistently since 2014, and the government has engaged in an impressive range of business environment and public financial management reforms. Expanded access to health, education, and infrastructure has seen rapid improvements in outcomes, with Afghanistan catching up with other low-income countries against key development indicators. While progress has been uneven, increased access to services and infrastructure has driven huge development gains.</p>
<p>At the same time, Afghanistan continues to experience insecurity and political uncertainty. Afghanistan's economy has been hard-hit by the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, due to negative impacts on consumption, exports, and remittances. Conflict is ongoing, and 2019 was the sixth year in a row when civilian causalities in Afghanistan exceeded 10,000. The displacement crisis persists, driven by intensified government and Taliban operations in the context of political negotiations. The number of conflict-induced IDPs increased from 369,700 in 2018 to 462,803 in 2019. An additional 505,000 refugees returned to Afghanistan, mainly from Iran, during 2019.</p>
<p>Following the agreement between the US and the Taliban agreement the “Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan” signed on February 29, 2020, the direct peace talks between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and Taliban started on 12 September but the process of a political settlement is only beginning. Meanwhile, the duration and extent of continued international security support is being questioned. Current international security and civilian grant support pledges are due to expire in 2020, creating uncertainty regarding future aid levels and the sustainability of security and development expenditures. This has fundamental implications for the economy, with growth and investment constrained by weak confidence.</p>
<p>Afghanistan's economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2019 driven by easing of drought conditions and rapid agricultural growth. Inflation remained modest at 2.3 percent. The trade deficit remains extremely large, at around 31 percent of GDP, financed mostly by grant inflows. Fiscal performance continued to improve in 2019 despite the elections with domestic revenues reaching 14.1 percent of GDP. Political uncertainties, however, dampened private sector confidence and non-agriculture growth. The basic needs poverty rate was 55 percent at the time of the last household survey (2016/17) and is expected to have worsened after the COVID-19 pandemic that hugely impacted the living condition of households.</p>
<p>The economy is expected to contract by up to five percent in 2020 with the negative impacts of the COVID-19 virus overshadowing improvements in weather conditions. Additional substantial downside risks remain, including political instability, deterioration of security conditions, premature reduction in aid flows, and further adverse regional economic or political developments. Poverty is expected to remain high, driven by weak labor demand and security-related constraints on service delivery.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis will have a serious and sustained impact on Afghanistan's economy. Recovery is expected to take several years, with new investment constrained by political uncertainties, continued insecurity, and questions around ongoing international support.</p>
<p>With declining grants and lower revenues, fiscal space is expected to remain highly constrained over the medium-term. Available fiscal resources should be used to protect vulnerable households and maintain delivery of basic services including healthcare. Recovery could be supported by rapid action to improve the business regulatory environment, including through measures to expand access to credit.</p>
<p>For development partners, the highest priority is ensuring continued and predictable grant support. Precipitous declines in grant flows over coming years would force major contraction in government services, undermining development outcomes and future growth prospects. Clear commitment to continued grant support is vital for any improvement in confidence and investment.</p>

        <p>Mozambique borders Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Eswatini. Its long, Indian Ocean coastline of 2,500 kilometers faces east to Madagascar.  </p>
<p>About two-thirds of its population of more than 29 million (2018) live and work in rural areas. It is endowed with ample arable land, water, energy, as well as mineral resources and newly discovered natural gas offshore; three, deep seaports; and a relatively large potential pool of labor. It is also strategically located; four of the six countries it borders are landlocked, and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets. Mozambique's strong ties to the region's economic engine, South Africa, underscore the importance of its economic, political, and social development to the stability and growth of Southern Africa as a whole. </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) and the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) remain the country's main political forces, followed by the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM). Renamo has maintained a considerable arsenal and military bases after the peace accord of 1992, and ever since the end of the civil war, the country has registered flare-ups of armed confrontations and violence.  A new peace accord was reached in August 2019, and has been violated several times by a Renamo breakaway military faction known as  Military Junta. The new peace deal aimed  at achieving  greater pacification of the country by integrating Renamo residual fighters into the national army, and  dismantling Renamo military bases splattered around the country. Meanwhile, the government is grappling with another so-called Islamic insurgency in parts of the gas-rich province of Cabo-Delgado. Initially circumscribed to one locality, the indiscriminate killing of civilians perpetrated by the insurgents has now spread to other districts and towns  in the province. Recently (March 2020) the rebels attacked and occupied  successively the transport hub rural town of Mocimboa da Praia and the town of Quissinga. Recent estimates show the conflict has killed more than 1,000 people and forced 100,000 from their homes. The risk that violence can spread to other areas of the country should not be underestimated. </p>
<p>Presidential, legislative, and provincial elections were held across the country on October 15, 2019, completing the country's sixth successive general elections  since the introduction of multiparty elections in 1994 . The incumbent party, Frelimo, won the presidency and the national parliament in a landslide. Frelimo also secured a majority in all 10 provinces, thus electing governors for each province.  </p>
<p><b>Economic Outlook </b></p>
<p>The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic reached Mozambique at a weak moment in its economic history, as the country attempted to recover from two major shocks: the hidden debt crisis and the devastating effects of cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019.  </p>
<p>In 2016, Mozambique's track record for high growth was disrupted when large, previously unreported external borrowing came to light. The revelation of undisclosed debt dented confidence in the country, increased debt levels, and more than halved the average rate of growth.  In 2019, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused massive damage to infrastructure and livelihoods, further lowering growth and wellbeing of the population. </p>
<p>The pandemic presents a further setback on the country's economic prospects. The pandemic dims the short-term growth prospects of Mozambique. The COVID-19 crisis will have a heavy impact on economic activity as social distancing and travel restrictions (domestically and globally) affect demand for goods and services. At the same time, reduced demand and prices of commodities are slowing the pace of investment in gas and coal, two key industries for Mozambique. With this, growth is expected to decline to 1.3% in 2020, down from a pre-COVID forecast of 4.3%, with significant downside risks. Mozambique is also expected to experience large external and fiscal financing gaps in 2020 and 2021 in a context characterized by exposure to external shocks and limited fiscal space. </p>
<p><b>Development Challenges </b></p>
<p>The country's main challenges include maintaining the macroeconomic stability considering exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and reestablishing confidence through improved economic governance and increased transparency, including the transparent handling of the hidden debt investigation. Moreover, structural reforms are needed in support of the currently struggling private sector. </p>
<p>Another major challenge is diversifying the economy by moving away from the current focus on capital-intensive projects and low-productivity subsistence agriculture, while strengthening the key drivers of inclusion, such as improved quality education and health service delivery, which could in turn improve social indicators.  </p>

        <p>Niger is a vast country located in the heart of the Sahel region. Its economy is not well diversified and depends primarily on agriculture, which accounts for 40% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Despite significant strides made by Niger over the past decade to reduce the country's poverty rate, the extreme poverty rate remained very high at 41.4% in 2019, affecting more than 9.5 million people.</p>
<p>Niger has, in recent years, also been grappling with a significant influx of refugees fleeing conflicts in the region, particularly in Nigeria and Mali. In April 2019, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) registered 221,671 refugees and 196,717 displaced persons, mainly in Diffa and Maradi.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>The current president, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamadou_Issoufou"" title=""Mahamadou Issoufou"">Mahamadou Issoufou</a>, was reelected to a second term in 2016. The next presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to take place in 2020-2021, preceded by municipal and regional elections. Security conditions have deteriorated in recent years, particularly in the areas bordering Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Mali, where armed groups have established bases and carry out repeated attacks against the security forces and civilians. To date, the government has declared a state of emergency in the Diffa, Tahoua, and Tillabéri regions.</p>
<p>In July 2017, the African Development Bank, the European Union, France, Germany, the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank launched the Sahel Alliance to provide an appropriate and coordinated response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since then, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.</p>
<p><b>Economic Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Niger's economic growth remained robust at 6.3% in 2019, </b>driven by agriculture, which benefited from favorable weather conditions and investments aimed at boosting agricultural productivity. Economic activity was also driven by the construction of infrastructure for the hosting of the African Union Summit in July 2019 and by major donor-supported projects. These achievements were realized despite a host of obstacles such as low commodity prices, a slowdown in trade triggered by the closure of the border with Nigeria since mid-August 2019, and escalating security challenges. The government prevented the spread of conflicts in Niger's border regions, thereby protecting the main economic activities.</li>
<li>
<b>Between 2018 and 2019, the fiscal deficit fell from 4.1% to 3.9% of GDP</b>. Higher government spending and lower domestic revenue were offset by an increase in grants.  Tax revenues did not increase substantially, owing primarily to the closure of the border with Nigeria, which resulted in a loss in import duties.  In addition, the sharp decline in domestically financed investment spending and tighter control of current expenditure helped contain public expenditure in 2019. Niger nevertheless remains one of three WAEMU countries that fail to meet WAEMU's fiscal convergence criterion of 3% of GDP.</li>
<li>
<b>The current external account deficit (grants included) widened to 19.5%</b> in 2019, driven by high import volumes associated with infrastructure projects. Substantial external capital inflows, concessional loans, and foreign direct investment financed a large share of the current external account deficit.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Medium-term Outlook</b></p>
<p>Three factors are likely to undermine Niger's economic performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, the global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) will strain Niger's economy, owing mainly to increased spending on health and social assistance services for vulnerable households aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19. The pandemic will also have an adverse impact on international trade and foreign direct investment channels.  </li>
<li>Deteriorating security conditions pose another major risk to economic growth and public finances.</li>
<li>Lower oil prices could adversely affect the real sector, public finances, and the balance of payments.</li>
<li>Niger also remains vulnerable to climate shocks and fluctuations in global non-oil commodity prices.</li>

        <p>Algeria is having to navigate a recession within the constraints of strict lockdown measures, introduced to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and a significant fall in the price and volume of international hydrocarbon exports in the first half of 2020. While the lockdown has helped reduce the spread of the virus, labor-intensive sectors—including services and construction, which remain largely inside the informal economy—have been deeply affected, resulting in many jobs being lost on a temporary or permanent basis, and many more jobs placed at risk.</p>
<p>This follows a year, 2019, marked by social mobilization and a political transition, in which the Algerian economy was modified by contracting hydrocarbon output along with more modest contributions to growth from services, agriculture, and construction. Algeria's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 0.8% in 2019—down from 1.2% in 2018—with a 2.4% expansion in non-hydrocarbons largely offset by a 4.9% decline in hydrocarbons. The 2019 unemployment rate remained unchanged at 11.4%, with men experiencing an improvement from 9.5% in 2018 to 9.1% in 2019, and women a deterioration from 19.5% to 20.4%.<b> </b>Algeria's twin deficits, dependent on hydrocarbon revenues, remained significant: The overall budget deficit deteriorated to -9.6% of GDP in 2019 as a result of a decline in hydrocarbon revenue and a rise in capital expenditure, while the current account deficit remained relatively unchanged at -10% of GDP. Algeria's foreign currency reserves steadily declined, reaching 13.6 months of imports at end-2019.</p>
<p>Algeria's long-term economic growth is slowing down, driven by a shrinking hydrocarbon sector, an overblown public-led model of growth, and a private sector struggling to take over as the new driver of growth. The hydrocarbon industry, which accounts for 19.5% of GDP, 41% of budget revenues, and 94% of product exports is undergoing structural decline. Algeria, like other oil-exporting countries across the MENA region, will need to shift towards a more diversified economic model if it wants to sustain higher economic growth rates and job creation. The decline in hydrocarbon revenues means that its current level of public spending can no longer be sustained. Policies to diversify the economy and increase budget revenues need to be complemented by measures to improve the efficiency and fairness of public spending to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population. The success of the National Socio-economic Recovery Plan under preparation will hinge on its ability to restore macroeconomic stability and enact decisive policies to support private sector development, while continuing to support the delivery of critical services.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, the hydrocarbon boom has allowed Algeria to make advances in economic and human development. The country cleared its external debt, invested in infrastructure projects, and implemented redistributive social policies that contributed to a significant reduction in poverty, as well as large improvements in Human Development Indicators. Algeria met the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is considered to have achieved universal primary education with a 97% primary net enrollment rate in 2015 (with gender parity); it also has increased its higher education enrollment rates. The quality of education needs to improve, however, with Algeria ranking 71 out of 72 for the performance of its student cohort of 15-year-olds in sciences, mathematics, and reading in the 2015 PISA assessment. According to the World Bank Group's <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/34432"">2020 Human Capital Index (HCI)</a>  providing a pre-pandemic baseline on the health and education of children, between 2010 and 2020 the HCI value for Algeria has remained relatively unchanged, at 0.53. This is higher than average for lower-middle-income countries, but lower than average for the Middle East and North Africa region.</p>

        <p>Ethiopia's location gives it strategic dominance as a jumping off point in the Horn of Africa, close to the Middle East and its markets. Ethiopia is landlocked, bordering Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, and Sudan, and has been using neighboring Djibouti's main port for the last two decades. However, with the recent peace with Eritrea, Ethiopia is set to resume accessing the Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa for its international trade.</p>
<p>With more than 112 million people (2019), Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and the fastest growing economy in the region. However, it is also one of the poorest, with a per capita income of $850. Ethiopia aims to reach lower-middle-income status by 2025.</p>
<p>Ethiopia's economy experienced strong, broad-based growth averaging 9.8% a year from 2008/09 to 2018/19, Ethiopia's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rebounded to 9% in 2018/19. Industry, mainly construction, and services accounted for most of the growth. Agriculture and manufacturing made lower contribution to growth in 2018/19 compared to the previous year. Private consumption and public investment explain demand-side growth, the latter assuming an increasingly important role.</p>
<p>Higher economic growth brought with it positive trends in poverty reduction in both urban and rural areas. The share of the population living below the national poverty line decreased from 30% in 2011 to 24% in 2016. The government is implementing the second phase of its Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II) which will run to 2019/20. GTP II aims to continue expanding physical infrastructure through public investments and to transform the country into a manufacturing hub. GTP II targets an average of 11% GDP growth annually, and in line with the manufacturing strategy, the industrial sector is set to expand by 20% on average, creating more jobs.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>Ethiopia's main challenges are sustaining its positive economic growth and accelerating poverty reduction, which both require significant progress in job creation, as well as improved governance. The government is devoting a high share of its budget to pro-poor programs and investments. Large scale donor support will continue to provide a vital contribution in the near-term to finance the cost of pro-poor programs. Key challenges are related to:</p>
<ul><li><p>Like the rest of the world, Ethiopia has been experiencing the unprecedented social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 shock is expected to be transitory with potential recovery possible in 2021, but the overall adverse economic impact on Ethiopia will be substantial. The economic impact of COVID-19 includes the increased price of basic foods, rising unemployment, slowdown in growth, and increase in poverty.</p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Ethiopia has been experiencing the worst locust invasion in decades. This may undermine development gains and threaten the food security and livelihoods of millions of Ethiopians.</p></li>
<li><p>Political disruption, associated with social unrest, could negatively impact growth through lower foreign direct investment, tourism and exports.</p></li>
<li><p>Limited competitiveness, which constrains the development of manufacturing, the creation of jobs and the increase of exports.</p></li>
<li><p>An underdeveloped private sector, which would limit the country's trade competitiveness and resilience to shocks. The government aims to expand the role of the private sector through foreign investment and industrial parks to make Ethiopia's growth momentum more sustainable.</p></li>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Iraq is in a fragile situation. The drop in oil prices and COVID-19 pandemic are placing unprecedented strains on its economy. A precarious political situation, weak healthcare system, ineffective social safety nets, rampant corruption, and dilapidated service delivery, all amplify this fragility and have fueled large-scale protests across the country. </p>
<p>While the new Government of Iraq (GoI) has been asserting its grip on security and illegal weapons and, in response to the protests, has announced a date for new parliamentary elections, it has been struggling to deal with the economic challenges it faces. Pre-existing conditions—its heavy dependence on oil, dominance of the state in economic activities, and a poor business environment—as well as budget rigidities, have combined to limit the government's capacity to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and to offer a stimulus package to restart the economy. </p>
<p>Faced with this multifaceted crisis, growth is expected to contract by 9.5% in 2020, Iraq's worst annual performance since 2003. Oil-GDP is expected to contract by 12% (capped by the OPEC+ agreement) while non-oil-GDP is expected to contract by 5% with sectors like religious tourism affected by COVID-19 measures. Subdued domestic demand and the depreciation of the currencies of Iraq's main trading partners have kept inflation in check at less than 1% in 2020.</p>
<p>The key challenge for Iraq will be to navigate this multi-dimensional crisis. The OPEC+ agreement, coupled with global recession, mean its prospects are on the downside, underscoring the importance of creating fiscal space for human capital, economic diversification, and job creation. Even with a recovery in oil prices, Iraq will need to undertake many reforms to rebuild fiscal space by cutting distortionary and inefficient spending and strengthening the medium-term orientation of macroeconomic policies. A failure to narrow the twin deficits and a rapid build-up in government debt would divert more resources away from productive investment and further reduce foreign exchange reserves and the economy's resilience to shocks. </p>
<p>As such, the outlook for Iraq will depend on global oil markets, the capacity of the Iraqi healthcare system to respond to COVID-19, and its economic reform process. If conditions ease, growth is projected to gradually return to 2 to 7.3% in 2021–2022, with the non-oil economy projected to bounce back to an average of 4%. In the absence of public wage bill and pension reforms, the fiscal deficit is projected to remain sizeable, averaging 12% of GDP in 2021–2022 amidst a modest recovery in oil prices. Consequently, Iraq's debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain elevated.</p>
<p>The current crises are likely to worsen the welfare of Iraqi households. After years of conflict and displacement, many are already vulnerable, and the pandemic will further test their resilience. While the disruption in supply chains will increase basic prices, household labor and non-labor incomes are likely to decrease due to the economic slowdown and reduced remittances. Many households, especially those in the informal private sector, may lose all their income, compelling them to exhaust their savings and resort to other coping mechanisms. </p>
<p>In the absence of a significant government response, these short-term effects, coupled with reduced access to education, healthcare, and other services will have lasting impacts on the ability of households either to escape poverty or remain above it. Projections suggest that poverty could increase by 7 to 14 percentage points, meaning that 2.7 to 5.5 million more Iraqis could become poor due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the existing 6.9 million poor, pre-COVID. </p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>The Republic of South Sudan became the world's newest nation and Africa's 55th country on July 9, 2011. Renewed conflicts in December 2013 and July 2016 have undermined the development gains achieved since independence and worsened the humanitarian situation. The gradual implementation of the September 2018 peace agreement including the formation of the unity government in February 2020 and agreement on number of states provided for a positive economic outlook earlier in 2020. Nonetheless, subsequent shocks that included flooding in parts of the country, locust infestation, COVID-19 pandemic, and lower oil prices have changed the outlook over a relatively short time period and exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>South Sudan remains in a serious humanitarian crisis due to the cumulative effects of years of conflict which has destroyed people's livelihoods. Extreme levels of acute food insecurity persist across the country and nearly 7.5 million (more than half of the population) in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in 2020. Almost 4 million people remain displaced by the humanitarian crisis, with nearly 1.6 million people displaced internally and some 2.26 million refugees in six neighboring countries. Women and children continue to be the most affected. A recent upsurge in ethnically motivated violence in parts of the country may exacerbate the humanitarian situation on the ground.</p>
<p>South Sudan is one of the most oil-dependent countries in the world, with oil accounting for almost the totality of exports, 90% of revenue, and more than one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP). The country's GDP per capita in 2014 was $1,111 dropping to less than $200 in 2017. Outside the oil sector, livelihoods are concentrated in low productive, unpaid agriculture and pastoralists work.</p>
<p>Coupled with economic mismanagement, many years of conflict have eroded the productive capacity of the country. As recent events have shown, the South Sudan economy is especially vulnerable to weather, oil price, and conflict related shocks. The economy had showed signs of recovery in FY 2018/19 with an estimated growth rate of 3.2% - the first positive GDP growth in five years. While the economy was expected to build on this positive turn and continue on a gradual growth trajectory, FY20 economic growth is estimated at -4.3%, once again highlighting the unique vulnerabilities of South Sudan. Inflation averaged 87% during the first nine months of FY2019/20 higher than during FY2018/19. The gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel market rate remains high and was estimated at 103% in June 2020.</p>
<p>South Sudan continues to under-invest in sectors that would have the largest knock-on effect on poverty reduction and building resilience, with expenditures skewed toward defense and security at the expense of service delivery. Consequently, poverty levels are expected to remain extremely high on the back of severe food insecurity and limited access to basic services across the country. About 82% of the population in South Sudan is poor according to the most recent estimates, based on the $1.90 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) poverty line.</p>
<p>The main priority for the government is to address the underlying causes of the conflict and restore peace and stability across the country in line with the provisions in the R-ARCSS. To ensure economic recovery, the government will need to implement comprehensive macroeconomic reforms, including measures to reduce inflation, address foreign exchange distortions, as well as longer term action to diversify the economy. Strengthening Public Financial Management systems and pursuing a people centered public investment program will support resilience, reduce poverty, build a stock of human capital, and secure the future.</p>

        <p>A landlocked Sahelian country in central Africa, Chad grapples with security challenges associated with conflicts in bordering countries as well as the impacts of climate change, which is exacerbating desertification and the drying up of Lake Chad.</p>
<p><b>With more than <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://reporting.unhcr.org/node/2533#_ga=2.96357343.270408414.1571428048-115620519.1571428048"">450,000 refugees</a></b> from Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Nigeria, Chad continues to deal with the consequences of tension in neighboring countries and hosts a high number of refugees, who represent approximately 4% of the country's total population. </p>
<p>Although Chad had made progress on poverty reduction, with a decline in the national poverty rate from 55% to 47% between 2003 and 2011, <b>the number of poor people is projected to increase from 4.7 million to 6.3 million </b>between 2011 and 2019.  The country is ranked last on the World Bank's <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">Human Capital Index</a>. This means that a child born in Chad today will be 71% less productive in adulthood than a child who received a quality education and benefited from appropriate health services. Moreover, 20% of Chadian children will not make it to their fifth birthday, and 40% of children suffer from stunting, which can have long-term implications for their cognitive development. Between the ages of 4 and 18, on average, children in Chad spend no more than five years in school. </p>
<p>Chad also has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in central Africa, with 856 deaths for every 100,000 live births. This phenomenon is aggravated by the high number of early pregnancies (164.5 births per 1,000 adolescents aged 15 to 19), which often lead to complications for the adolescents. </p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>President Idriss Déby Itno and his party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), have dominated Chadian politics since ascending to power in December 1990. The new constitution, promulgated in 2018, allows the President to run for two additional consecutive terms of six years when his current term comes to an end in 2021.</p>
<p>The Independent National Electoral Commission announced that the first round of the presidential elections will be held on April 11, 2021. Legislative and municipal elections, which have been postponed several times because of a lack of funds, are scheduled to be held on October 24, 2021. </p>
<p><b>Economic Outlook</b></p>
<ul><li><p>Chad joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003 and since then its economy has been heavily dependent on oil. The country's previously agrarian economy saw per capita GDP grow from about $497 in 2001/02 (which was less than half of the average in Sub-Saharan Africa) to around $823 in 2017. </p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p>After two years of a deep recession caused by the drop in oil prices, the economy showed signs of recovery in 2018. GDP grew by 3.2% in 2019, however, but is expected to decline sharply in 2020 to 0.8%, owing to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p></li>
<li><p>The external current account deficit fell from 6.6% to 4.7% between 2018 and 2019 as a result of the hike in oil prices and strong oil export performance. The government is continuing its fiscal accommodation efforts by mobilizing revenue and controlling recurrent costs. </p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>In June 2018, Chad finalized the restructuring of its oil-collateralized loan with the Glencore petroleum company. This agreement and the planned clearance of arrears is expected to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio from 51.9% in 2017 to 41.2% in 2020. The risk of external debt overhang nevertheless remains high.</p></li>
<li><p>In the medium term, oil exports will remain a key driver of GDP growth. Moreover, the privatization of the public cotton company is expected to considerably improve the contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP growth. </p></li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p>Chad's economy remains fragile and is vulnerable to considerable risk, such as oil price volatility and regional insecurity. Chad would benefit from investment in key sectors, such as infrastructure, education, and health to mitigate these risks. </p></li></ul>

<p>Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, Croatia recorded steady economic growth of close to 3 percent. A convergence to the European Union (EU) income average remained elusive, however. </p>
<p>Attaining higher growth rates was constrained by structural rigidities and a strong reliance on less innovative activities, with lower value added and limited backward and forward linkages. As a result, only in 2019 did the economy reach its pre-global financial crisis level of output. </p>
<p>A severe economic recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is reversing the income gains, poverty reduction, and fiscal sustainability that Croatia achieved during the past five years. In addition, the March earthquake in Zagreb and its environs has strained the functioning of public institutions and caused extensive damage that will take years to repair. </p>
<p>Although it is expected that the crisis will be short lived and the recovery will gain momentum in 2021, there remains a high level of uncertainty, and risks are tilted to the downside. A further worsening of the pandemic globally cannot be excluded, which might require the re-imposition of stringent social distancing measures. </p>
<p>The crisis could nevertheless provide an opportunity for Croatia to revisit its growth model and focus on policies to increase resilience to exogenous shocks and raise growth potential.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Next Generation EU, the new EU temporary recovery instrument, if used adequately and efficiently, could support the country's investments and policy reforms, enabling it to emerge stronger from the crisis.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>For almost a year, Lebanon has been assailed by compounded crises—specifically, an economic and financial crisis, followed by COVID-19, and lastly the explosion at the Port of Beirut (PoB). </p>
<p>In October 2019, the economy plunged into a financial crisis brought about by a sudden stop in capital inflows, which precipitated systemic failures across the banking sector and debt sector, as well as effecting the exchange rate. Subsequently, on March 7, 2020, the Government defaulted on the redemption of a US$1.2 billion Eurobond, marking Lebanon's first-ever sovereign default. Then, on March 18, the Government declared a State of General Mobilization, imposing a lockdown to counter COVID-19 that included the closure of the borders (air, sea, and land) and of public and private institutions. Lastly, on August 4, 2020, a massive explosion rocked the Port of Beirut, destroying much of the port and severely damaging dense residential and commercial areas within a 1- to 2-mile radius of it. </p>
<p>Beyond the human tragedy, the economic impact of the explosion has implications at the national level, despite the explosion's geographical concentration. This adds to long-term structural vulnerabilities that include low-grade infrastructure—a dysfunctional electricity sector, water supply shortages, inadequate solid waste and wastewater management—public financial mismanagement, large macroeconomic imbalances, and deteriorating social indicators. </p>
<p>Immediately after the Port of Beirut explosion, the World Bank Group (WBG), in cooperation with the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU), launched a <a href=""http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/650091598854062180/pdf/Beirut-Rapid-Damage-and-Needs-Assessment.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA)</a> to estimate the impact on the population, physical assets, infrastructure, and service delivery. </p>
<p>The RDNA followed a “whole of Lebanon approach” by engaging the public authorities, institutions, and civil society organizations concerned. The assessment found that the value of damage from the explosion was in the range of US$3.8 to 4.6 billion, with losses to financial flows of US$2.9 to US$3.5 billion. The impact is particularly severe in key sectors vital for growth, including finance, housing, tourism, and commerce. Through to the end of 2021, the costs of recovery and reconstruction are expected to total US$1.8 to $2.2 billion. Apart from losses in economic activity, Lebanon can expect lower fiscal revenues, higher inflation, and a further rise in poverty. Trade disruptions are also possible, which would raise transaction costs and further impede growth. The RDNA recommends a framework for Reform, Recovery, and Reconstruction (the '3Rs') to build back a better Lebanon, one based on principles of transparency, inclusion, and accountability. The 3Rs' framework combines people-centered interventions with structural reforms that include macroeconomic stabilization and ensuring human security, and reforms to governance mechanisms and the private-sector's operating environment.</p>
<p>Building a better Lebanon will require swift and decisive action, particularly on reform. In the immediate term, Lebanon needs to adopt and implement a credible, comprehensive, and coordinated macro-financial stability strategy, within a medium-term macro-fiscal framework. This strategy would be based on: (i) a debt restructuring program aimed at achieving debt sustainability over the medium-term; (ii) a comprehensive restructuring of the financial sector toward regaining the solvency of the banking sector; (iii) a new monetary policy framework aimed at regaining confidence in the exchange rate and its stability; (iv) a phased fiscal adjustment aimed at regaining confidence in fiscal policy; (v) growth enhancing reforms; and (vi) enhanced social protection. </p>
<p>Over the medium-term, Lebanon will have to prioritize building better institutions, good governance, and a better business environment, alongside physical reconstruction. However, given Lebanon's state of insolvency (sovereign, banking system) and its lack of sufficient foreign exchange reserves, international aid and private investment will be essential for a comprehensive recovery and reconstruction. The extent and speed to which aid and investments are mobilized will depend on whether the authorities and the Lebanese Parliament can act swiftly on enacting much needed fiscal, financial, social, and governance reforms. Without reforms, there can be no sustainable recovery and reconstruction, and the social and economic situation will continue to worsen.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Maldives has a population of around 515,696 people dispersed across 185 islands. The country has been a development success; enjoying robust growth coupled with considerable development of the country's infrastructure and connectivity. It has also provided high quality and affordable public services for its people, resulting in impressive health and education indicators with a literacy rate approaching 100%, and life expectancy of over 78 years. More than 30 percent of the population live in the capital city Male'. Maldives ranks 101 out of 189 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) for 2017, the second highest HDI rank in South Asia. The country's GDP per capita reached $11,890 in 2018, compared to $200 in 1978.</p>
<p>The country is physically vulnerable to rising sea levels. Eighty percent of the total land area of the country, which is less than 300 square kilometers, is lower than 1 meter above the mean sea level. The country's exposure to natural hazards and climate variability poses a threat to lives and the economy. The additional challenge of the country's geography leads to a dispersed population across many small islands, which makes service delivery difficult and can limit opportunities for job creation and economic diversification. Compounded with inclusion issues, this has caused relatively elevated levels of youth unemployment at 15.3 percent and low rates of women participating in the workforce.</p>
<p>To respond to these challenges, the government has reversed centralization policies of the previous government, promising to empower local councils by allocating a portion of the annual state budget and to develop at least 5 regional economic hubs across the archipelago. The government has also embarked on a series of reforms to restore democratic institutions and the freedom of the press, re-establish the justice system, and protect fundamental human rights. Also high on the current government's agenda is climate change.</p>
<p><b><u>Recent Developments</u></b></p>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has had a debilitated effect on tourism, which directly and indirectly accounts for two-thirds of GDP. Revenues fell by an estimated 23.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 (year-on-year) as tourist-related revenues shrank, whereas spending grew by 10.2 percent. Real GDP contracted by 5.9 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q1 2020. The shock is expected to be larger in Q2 due to border closure and stringent mobility restrictions. Tourism inflows remained anemic even after borders reopened in mid-July. Construction, the other main driver of growth, also slumped due to logistical difficulties and repatriations of foreign workers following COVID-19 outbreaks.</p>
<p>Fiscal imbalances have widened significantly. Although the state collected only USD 471 million in revenues and grants from January to July (half the amount in the corresponding period of 2019), there was no commensurate adjustment in spending. While there was some degree of fiscal consolidation on the recurrent side, capital spending grew by 16.7 percent y-o-y in the first half of the year, mainly due to land reclamation and harbor reconstruction projects. Total spending amounted to USD 948 million over January to July, only 1.2 percent less than over the same period in 2019. Total public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt rose to USD 4.8 billion as of end-June 2020, a significant increase from USD 4.4 billion as of end-2019. </p>
<p><b><u>Outlook</u></b></p>
<p>In a baseline scenario that assumes borders remain open and tourists gradually return, GDP is projected to shrink by 19.5 percent in 2020. Thereafter, it is expected to rebound to 9.5 percent growth in 2021, largely on account of base effects and the expected resumption of tourism once a COVID-19 vaccine is commercially available, tentatively by mid-year. However, real GDP is forecast to remain below 2019 levels until 2023.</p>
<p>Lower remittance outflows and some import compression should help to narrow the current account deficit to 19.5 percent of GDP in 2020. However, the fiscal deficit is projected to more than triple to 22.5 percent of GDP as expenditures have not sufficiently adjusted to lower revenue levels, which are projected to halve. As a result, PPG debt is expected to reach 120 percent of GDP in 2020.</p>
<p>COVID-19 will likely cancel the gains in poverty reduction from the last five years. The poverty rate is projected to increase to 5.6 percent in 2020 (measured at USD 5.50 a day in PPP terms) and to decline very slowly thereafter. <a name=""_Hlk50452506"" id=""_Hlk50452506""></a>Even in the baseline scenario, the poverty rate would still be higher in 2021 than in 2016.</p>
<p><b><u>Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>Should a ‘second wave' materialize and prevent tourists from visiting in Q4 2020, the recession would be even more severe. While the unique “one island, one resort” concept facilitates socially-distanced vacations, difficulties in resuming commercial flights and recent increases in domestic transmission pose challenges to attracting more visitors. Although medium- and long-term tourism prospects remain strong, visitor arrivals are not projected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.  Meanwhile, the potential closure of tourist establishments and other small businesses could result in permanent supply-side losses, hurting long-term growth.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of slower growth and lower revenues, addressing core spending needs will be a challenge. Additional financing may be difficult to raise in the near-term given rising debt levels and the global nature of the shock. Greater fiscal prudence would help address fiscal and debt sustainability risks. In particular, large public infrastructure investments that are not urgently needed in a context of weak aggregate demand could be postponed.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 shock has shed renewed light on the importance of strengthening the Maldives' resilience to external shocks. Although there are plans to develop agriculture and fishing to diversify the economy, the scarcity of arable land is a binding constraint. Focusing on higher value-added financial and business services could create good jobs, but the growth of these sectors is currently constrained by a shortage of local skills. Investing in human capital, including by retraining and upskilling workers, can help Maldives build back better.  </p>

        <p>Mauritania is essentially a desert country, with vast expanses of pastoral land and only 0.5% of arable land. According to the National Statistics Office, Mauritania has a population of about 4 million (2018), and a population density of 3.9 inhabitants per square kilometer, making it the fourth least densely populated country in Africa. By 2020, the country will have more urban than rural inhabitants, with 52.8% of the population living in urban areas, against 48.3% in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Following the decision by President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz to abide by the Constitution and not seek a third term, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani won the first round of the presidential elections held on June 22, 2019 with 52% of the vote, marking the first democratic transition of power in Mauritania. President Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani assumed office in August 2019 and formed his government.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The economy continued its gradual recovery in 2018. GDP growth has been on an upward trajectory since 2015, rising from 3.1% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2018. This increase was driven by robust activity in the telecommunications, transport, electricity, and primary sectors.</li>
<li>By contrast, the extractive sector continues to curb growth. In addition, strong population growth (roughly 2.8%) is outstripping the pace of economic recovery, which remains slow, with real GDP per capita income having risen a mere 0.6%. This situation jeopardizes the gains made in poverty reduction between 2008 and 2014.</li>
<li>The fiscal position continued to improve in 2018. Efforts to achieve fiscal rebalancing helped transform the deficit of 0.3% of GDP in 2017 into a surplus of 1.5% in 2018, the first surplus since 2013. <a name=""_Toc5116097"" id=""_Toc5116097""></a>However, unfavorable terms of trade, combined with persistent production challenges in the extractive industries, exacerbated the current account deficit, which rose from 13.9% of GDP in 2018 to 18.7% of GDP in 2019. Despite the deepening deficit, financing was ensured by an increase of foreign direct investment linked to offshore gas exploration and financial flows from the extractive sectors.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Medium-Term Outlook</b></p>
<p>The medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to increase to an average of 6.2% for the 2019-2021 period. Continued expansion of the primary sector, strengthening of the services sector through the implementation of structural reforms, and an increase in mining production are expected to keep the country on this sound path. This robust macroeconomic framework is expected to strengthen, provided the government maintains fiscal prudence, by ensuring that public debt remains viable. An improvement in the terms of trade owing to an increase in international iron prices is expected to mitigate external pressures and allow the central bank to respond to financing needs.</p>
<p><b>Social Context</b></p>
<p>Mauritania experienced sustained GDP growth from 2008 to 2014, accompanied by significant improvements in household welfare. The annual real growth in mean household expenditure per capita was 1.52%. All quantiles did well and there was a sharp decline in the proportion of poor, which fell from 44.5% of the country's population in 2008 to 33% in 2014. The improvement in living standards has been more marked among the poor and extremely poor than among the non-poor. Inequality has narrowed, as  the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, decreased from 35.3 in 2008 to 31.9 in 2014. These developments are explained by improvements in production, productivity, and income in rural areas following the restructuring of the agriculture and livestock sector and by other factors such as internal migration and changes in relative prices.</p>
<p>However, some population groups in Mauritania have not benefited from this phenomenon, and the country is still lagging on many social indicators. Poverty has not fallen in the capital, Nouakchott, probably because of migration to urban areas and because the capital tends to attract the poorest of the poor. Labor force participation and the employment rate have not improved, and groups that have not benefited from social progress, such as youth, <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/09/18/coming-together-to-help-african-girls-create-a-brighter-future"">women</a>, and low-income workers, are increasingly marginalized. Only 55% of children aged 6 to 11 are enrolled in primary school, one third of households live in precarious housing, and 38% of the population has access to electric lighting.</p>

<p>Ukraine has experienced acute political, security, and economic challenges during the past six years. Since the “Maidan” uprising in February 2014, the country has witnessed several momentous events, including the outbreak of conflict in eastern Ukraine. From 2014 until 2019, the Government undertook key reforms, including: carrying out significant fiscal consolidation, moving to a flexible exchange rate, reforming energy tariffs and social assistance, enhancing the transparency of public procurement, simplifying business regulations, stabilizing and restructuring the banking sector, moving forward on health and pension reforms, and establishing anti-corruption agencies.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ukrainians continue to feel more needs to be done to improve governance. Lack of trust in public institutions remains a fundamental concern for most people, and surveys reveal that many feel  that corruption remains endemic—from the financial sector to health care—and that powerful oligarchs still dominate the economy.</p>
<p>Current President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected on April 21, 2019, in a runoff election with former President Petro Poroshenko, winning 73 percent of the vote. On July 21, 2019, President Zelenskyy's Servant of the People Party won the parliamentary elections, giving them 60 percent of the seats in the Rada. The resulting government, which took office in August 2019, and the new government, re-appointed in March 2020, have both committed to an ambitious and wide-ranging reform agenda.</p>

        <p>Extreme poverty is estimated to have risen from 29% in 2018 to 34% in 2019, an increase from 4.7 to 5.7 million people. The increase is driven by economic contraction and the sharp rise in prices of food and basic commodities. Contraction of agricultural production following an El Nino induced drought worsened the situation in rural areas. One tenth of the rural households currently indicate they are going without food for a whole day, about double the proportion of urban households. Additionally, Cyclone Idai has worsened the situation in three key provinces that typically account for 30% of agricultural output.  The drought has also led to broader impact on the electricity and water sectors, causing widespread rationing and tariff adjustments to manage costs.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to contract by 7.5% in 2019. Shortages of foreign currency, fuel, electricity, severe drought and Cyclone Idai dampened economic activity, especially in mining and agriculture, which experienced double-digit declines. Production of major minerals like gold, diamond and coal fell by more than 27% while production of maize, the main staple food, was less than half of its level in 2018, resulting in wide-spread food insecurity. Domestic demand weakened significantly as job losses and rapidly increasing inflation eroded disposable incomes of households while fiscal austerity kept government spending low.</p>
<p>Inflation has been increasing since October 2018, driven by monetization of sizable fiscal deficits of the past, price distortions, and local currency depreciation. Annual inflation reached 230% in July 2019 (compared to 5.4% in September 2018), with food prices rising by 319% in July 2019 while non-food inflation increased by 194%.  Adjustment of external accounts was swift with the current account reaching a surplus in the first quarter of 2019 for the first time since 2009. The trade deficit also narrowed significantly in January-July 2019 as imports contracted by 31% (year-on-year) on the back of forex liquidity constraints and weak demand.</p>
<p>The government mandated the use of the Zimbabwe dollar as a sole legal tender on June 24, ending the multicurrency regime in place for over a decade. However, with critically low levels of official reserves, constrained access to external financing and limited tools by Central Bank to sterilize the economy, the local currency has continued to depreciate. Inflation is projected to continue increasing and to average close to 180% in 2019 before slowing down in 2020.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit is projected at around 4.9% of GDP in 2019 and will gradually decrease to 4.5% and 4.4% of GDP in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Fiscal consolidation measures agreed under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff Monitored Program are expected to contain spending growth and halt monetization of the fiscal deficit. However, the supplementary budget presented on August 1, 2019 envisages a significant increase in spending to counter the negative impacts of the drought, upward adjustment of wages, and increase in social spending. Potential spending overruns (especially driven by agriculture subsidies and wages) could widen the fiscal deficit and exacerbate macroeconomic instability, including the already high inflation. </p>
<p>Poverty is projected to remain stagnant in 2020 as positive impacts of a rebound in agricultural production will be countered by the negative effects of continued high inflation, further undermining the purchasing power of the poor. Continued cash shortages as well as weak targeting of public spending on social safety nets will continue to constrain social programs and the impact on poverty.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth is projected to pick up to 2.7 % in 2020, driven by a rebound in agriculture as rains largely return to normal. However, shortages of foreign currency and electricity are projected to persist in 2020, negatively affecting the recovery of industry and services.  Weak domestic demand is likely to translate into a small current account deficit in 2019 (around 1% of GDP) which is likely to slightly increase in 2020 given continued foreign currency shortages.</p>
<p>In the absence of international support, Zimbabwe macroeconomic challenges may persist. With dwindling reserves, there is a high-risk exchange rate overshooting, contributing to inflationary pressures. Climate related risks may constrain recovery of the agriculture sector in the medium-term exacerbating food insecurity. Social and political pressures could lead to policy slippage, delay macroeconomic stabilization and political reforms. This might jeopardize the reform agenda under the IMF Staff Monitored Program and delay the government's re-engagement aspirations.</p>

<p>Belarus has pursued a gradual transition path, characterized by limited structural reforms and a modest expansion of the private sector. Economic growth during 2003–13 was accompanied by an impressive fall in the number of households below the national poverty line and an increase in household income among the bottom 40 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the factors that enabled Belarus's past success are no longer in play. The capacity of capital accumulation to drive economic growth is exhausted, the energy subsidies stemming from bilateral agreements with Russia are declining and will be withdrawn by 2024, and public debt ratios to GDP are growing. Henceforth, improved living standards must come from higher productivity.</p>
<p>The economy is expected to contract by 2.8 percent in 2020, following the drag from COVID-19 and headwinds from increased political tensions. The recession is expected to deepen in 2021, reflecting a significant retrenchment in household spending and investment demand due to heightened uncertainty and the lack of fiscal and monetary policy space to support the economy. Long-standing structural challenges related to the dominance of low-productivity state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the high degree of dollarization, and external vulnerabilities are expected to weigh on the recovery thereafter.</p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed Brazil to an unprecedented health and economic challenge. To contain the pandemic, Brazil implemented social measures to slow the spread of the virus and contain its impact on the health system capacity, which is uneven across the country. The pandemic found Brazil with a fragile recovery and limited fiscal policy space following the 2015/16 recession.</p>
<p>The pandemic, and the health policy response to it, have resulted into a sharp decline of external demand and affect domestic demand and constraint supply. In the second quarter, the economy contracted by a historic 9.7 percent.  As a result, Brazil GDP is projected to decline in 2020, followed by rebound in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>The pandemic has brought uncertainties to the macroeconomic policy framework, especially in the fiscal scenario, which translate into downside risks, calling for strong fiscal consolidation and adoption of structural reforms in 2021. To protect the most vulnerable people, the Government has put forward a large, timely, targeted and time bound fiscal package focused on social assistance. The cost of this package is estimated at BRL 713.4 billion (US$135.4 billion), or 10.4 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Lower tax revenues from a weakened economy and the associated fiscal measures adopted are expected to increase the primary deficit of the general government in 2020. Despite historically low interest rates, the pandemic aggravated the challenges to stabilize public debt, that is likely to surpass 90 percent of GDP in 2020. To regain lost ground, it will be critical to ensure that emergency measures remain temporary and that long-term fiscal sustainability remains anchored in Brazil's expenditure rule.</p>
<p>Following the dramatic decreases in domestic and international demand resulting from the pandemic during the first half of the year, Brazil is projected to fall into its deepest recession on record. While activities normalize, the crisis created a steep drop in labor income and employment, increasing the likelihood of falling into poverty among low-salary workers and informal workers – two groups where vulnerable groups were overrepresented before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate reached 13.3 percent in June 2020 (14.9 percent for women), the highest rate in the past three years. However, due to the broad social response from government to support private consumption, sectors like industry and commerce show a partial rebound, while the services sector's recovery remains heterogeneous across subsectors.</p>
<p>COVID-19 hit as Brazil was still recovering from its 2014-16 recession. Economic recovery remained weak since the peak of the recession in 2015-2016, with 1.3 percent real GDP growth recorded in 2017 and 2018 and 1.1 percent GDP growth in 2019. When the COVID-19 crisis hit, Brazil's poorest were still recovering from the 2014-2016 recession, with the income of the poorest 40 percent remaining below the pre-2014 crisis level. As of 2018, 19.9 percent of the population lived on less than US$5.50 per day (2011 PPP), including 9.3 million people on less than US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP) – the global reference for extreme poverty.[1]</p>
<p>The pandemic will curb incomes across the entire income distribution. However, due to the AE, poverty is projected to decrease in 2020. Yet this drop is likely to be reversed as the emergency measures expire and the labor market is not able to fully absorb the unemployed.</p>
<p>Despite the recession, Brazil's macroeconomic framework is expected to remain broadly adequate, albeit with substantial downside risks, calling for strong fiscal consolidation and adoption of structural reforms, some of which have already started to remove critical bottlenecks for productivity growth. Brazil has suffered low productivity growth over the last two decades due to, among other factors, a cumbersome business environment, distortionary tax system, inadequate business support programs and a domestic market relatively closed to trade and external competition.</p>
<p>Brazil also lacks adequate investment in infrastructure (2.1 percent of GDP on average between 2000 and 2013), resulting in a deterioration of the infrastructure stock that creates acute bottlenecks for production. With limited fiscal space and a dwindling demographic bonus, accelerating productivity growth remains key to sustain economic growth. To this end, the federal government aims to approve new legislations for key infrastructure sectors (energy, telecom, railways). A new legal framework for the water and sanitation sector was recently approved in Congress.</p>
<p>The government is also opening markets to private sector participation through concessions (airports), foreign investment (air passenger transport) and PPPs (e.g. ports). On the trade side, to foster Brazil's integration in the global economy the government has concluded new trade agreements, starting with the Mercosur/EU and Mercosur/EFTA agreements recently concluded and on-going negotiations with Canada, Korea and Singapore.</p>
<p>The Central Bank is leading a reform program to create key instruments (positive credit database, credit guarantees, electronic invoicing credit, etc.) to foster competition in the financial markets. Through the tax reform, the government expects to improve the business environment by making the system simpler and less distorting and bringing more judicial safety.</p>

        <p>Located 500 kilometers off the west coast of Africa, Cabo Verde is an archipelago of 10 islands. The country has an estimated population of 520,500 spread across nine islands that are scattered within a large water area, which constitutes a major constraint to growth and development. Only 10% of its territory is classified as arable land, and the country possesses limited mineral resources. </p>
<p>Cabo Verde's economy <b>is driven by tourism grounded in year-round attractive weather, beautiful beaches, stable democracy, limited security risks and proximity to Europe</b>. Its limited economies of scale create significant connectivity issues, as well as challenges for service delivery including energy, water, education, and health.  </p>
<p>Despite the challenges associated with being a small island economy, <b>Cabo Verde witnessed spectacular social and economic progress between 1990 and 2008</b>, driven mainly by the rapid development of inclusive tourist resorts </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>Politics in Cabo Verde have been largely consensus-oriented, and since its independence from Portugal in 1975, Cabo Verde has not experienced a single coup d'état. Elections are considered free and fair, and parties in power alternate regularly. </p>
<p>The current Government of Cabo Verde has been in office since the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2016, which led to a change with the victory of the opposition Movimento para Democracia (MpD) after 15 years of government under the Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde (PAICV). These two parties dominate Cabo Verde's political scene and are both fairly centrist. The next legislative and presidential elections are scheduled for the first half of 2021. </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview </b></p>
<p>During the period of 2009-2015, economic growth decelerated significantly, a result of the protracted impact of the global financial crisis. Countercyclical fiscal measures did not restore growth and instead led to a sharp increase in the stock of public debt. </p>
<p><b>Gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovery started in 2016 and reached 5.5% in 2019</b> (4.2 in per capita terms), well above the potential growth rate of 3.6%. On the demand side, growth was driven by high consumption (public and private) and strong export performance. On the supply side, construction, retail, transport, and tourism services contributed to the dynamism of the economy. Tourism and travel-related industries represent 25% of GDP and drive around 40% of overall economic performance. The primary fiscal balance stood at 0.7% of GDP in 2019, turning positive for the first time in a decade. The overall fiscal deficit declined from 2.8% of GDP in 2018 to 1.9% in 2019. Improved fiscal performance is due to central government consolidation efforts combined with the reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  However, the risk of external debt distress remains high.  </p>
<p>The unfolding <b>COVID-19 crisis will reduce economic growth, delay fiscal consolidation, halt public debt decline, and slow poverty reduction</b> in Cabo Verde. GDP growth is expected to have the largest contraction on record in 2020, The country relies heavily on tourism that is the hardest hit sector. <b>Tourism receipts alone are expected to decline by 70% </b>compared to 2019. The crisis opened a large fiscal financing gap in 2020, which has been filled mainly by concessional borrowing and grants from Development Partners. The World Bank has responded to this crisis with three operations: the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://documents.banquemondiale.org/fr/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/728971592531211396/cabo-verde-africa-p173857-cabo-verde-covid-19-emergency-response-project-procurement-plan"">COVID-19 Emergency Response Project</a>; the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P160628?lang=en"">Cabo Verde Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Financing with CAT-DDO</a>; and the Second State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Reform and Fiscal Management Development Policy Financing (DPF) that is under preparation.

<p>Recurrent episodes of institutional and political instability have hindered Haiti's economic and social development. GDP annual growth averaged only 1.3% over the past two decades. GDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.4% in 2019, and the country has experienced rapid currency depreciation (25.5%), and rampant inflation (17.3%) at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already weak economy and political instability in Haiti. While the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Haiti remains relatively low compared to other countries in the region, the number of cases has been rising, and the country is still very vulnerable. COVID-19 is expected to lead to significant economic losses and could set back poverty reduction efforts. The pandemic is expected to disproportionately affect the poor and most vulnerable populations, including women, reinforcing existing social inequalities. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/34602"">Economic growth is expected to decline to GDP by 3.1 % in 2020</a> as the service sector contracts, supply chains are disrupted, and remittances fall as the global economy heads into recession. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen to over 6% of GDP (from a pre-COVID-19 forecast of 3%) and inflation is expected to reach over 20%. The pace and shape of economic recovery will depend on the progression of the pandemic and its ramifications throughout the global economy, and progress toward resolution of the lingering political crisis.</p>
<p>In addition to the challenges posed by the pandemic, Haiti remains highly vulnerable to natural hazards, mainly hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. More than 96% of the population is exposed to these natural hazards. Hurricane Matthew, which hit the country in 2016, caused losses and damages estimated at 32% of 2015 GDP. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity, and impacts of extreme weather events in the country.</p>

        <p>During recent years, Honduras had registered the second highest economic growth rates in Central America, only behind Panama. The country's GDP growth reached 4.8 percent in 2017, 3.7 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019, above the average in Central America and well above the average in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).</p>
<p>Honduras possesses multiple strengths with the potential for a faster growth and higher shared prosperity, with its strategic location, a growing industrial base, ongoing efforts to diversify its exports, and a young and growing population.</p>
<p>However, the country has been facing high levels of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/HND"">poverty and inequality</a>. A 48.3 percent of people live in poverty in the country (2018, with updated official poverty lines) and the percentage of people living in poverty in rural areas (60.1 percent) is higher than those living in poverty in urban areas (38.4 percent). Inequality (GINI <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?locations=HN"">52.1 in 2018</a>, among the highest in the region and the world) has also resulted in one of the smallest middle classes in LAC (11 percent in 2015, compared with 35 percent regional average).</p>
<p>In addition, Honduras struggles with high levels of violence, with over <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?locations=HN"">38 homicides</a> per 100,000 inhabitants (2018). Moreover, Honduras is vastly exposed to adverse natural events and climate change, especially heavy rainfall and drought that occur regularly and disproportionately affect the poor.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly impacting Honduras's economy. The country's GDP is expected to contract by 7.1 percent in 2020 due to a sharper than expected fall in trade, investment and consumption amid the global slowdown and prolonged containment measures. A deeper than expected GDP contraction and high unemployment in the United States –the key trade and investment partner for Honduras and the largest source of remittances– amplified this contraction. The employment and income losses are expected to impact the poor, the near poor and the middle class.</p>
<p>To minimize the impact on economic activity and social welfare, the Government adopted strict containment measures, authorizing new borrowing for US$2.5 billion (10 percent of the GDP), and prioritized healthcare and humanitarian services, including basic needs support to the poor, as well as support to firms. A prudent macroeconomic framework helped contain vulnerabilities, buoyed by the IMF program.</p>
<p>The country's economy is expected to rebound in 2021 to a 4.9 percent growth, amid the reactivation of domestic economic activity and recovering investment and external demand; but risks and challenges remain. A deeper global downturn amid the prolonged pandemic could weaken economic recovery and continue to threaten the health and welfare of the population.</p>
<p>Continued focus on boosting competitiveness in rural economic development, investing in human capital and strengthening social protection in Honduras can also improve social outcomes and support recovery by fostering more job and economic opportunities among the country's most vulnerable. Institutional reforms on key issues, such as improving the sustainability of the electricity sector, as well as governance and the business climate, can also contribute to further developing a framework for inclusive growth in Honduras.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>The Peruvian economy has experienced two distinct phases of economic development since the turn of the century. Between 2002 and 2013, Peru was one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America, with an average GDP growth rate of 6.1 percent annually. Prudent macroeconomic policies and broad-reaching structural reforms in a favorable external environment created a scenario of high growth and low inflation.</p>
<p>The strong growth in employment and income sharply reduced poverty rates. The poverty rate (the percentage of the population living on USD 5.5 a day) fell from 52.2 percent in 2005 to 26.1 percent in 2013. This is equivalent to 6.4 million people escaping poverty during that period. Extreme poverty (the population living on USD 3.2 a day) declined from 30.9 percent to 11.4 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>Between 2014 and 2019, GDP growth slowed to an annual average rate of 3.1 percent, mainly owing to lower international commodity prices, including copper, the leading Peruvian export commodity. This led to a temporary reduction in private investment, less fiscal income and a slowdown in consumption. Two factors attenuated the impact of this external shock on GDP, enabling continued growth, albeit at a slower pace. The first was the prudent management of fiscal, monetary and exchange policies, especially during the boom. This enabled the country to endure the decline in fiscal income without drastically adjusting spending and to have international reserves for an ordered adjustment of the exchange rate. Second was the surge in mining production as projects implemented during the previous years matured, which increased exports and offset the deceleration in domestic demand.</p>
<p>In this context, the current account deficit diminished, from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.5 percent in 2019. This external deficit has been financed mainly with long-term capital inflows. Net international reserves remained stable, reaching 30 percent of GDP by March 2020.</p>
<p>As part of the adjustment, the fiscal deficit has temporarily increased, reaching a peak of 3.0 percent of GDP in 2017. The higher deficit stems from a decline in revenues resulting from lower commodity prices and the economic slowdown, and an increase in recurrent expenditures in recent years, especially for goods, services and wages.  Fiscal revenues rebounded in the two subsequent years, reducing the fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2019.</p>
<p>Peru has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A strict generalized quarantine led to a GDP decline of 17.4% in the first half of 2020. According to the World Bank High Frequency Surveys, Peruvian households experienced one of the largest employment and income losses in LAC. Employment losses and risk aversion will affect consumption during the rest of the year, while uncertainty will continue to hamper the recovery of private investment. The government has developed a comprehensive economic relief and aid program to protect the vulnerable population and support companies, including cash- transfers, tax payments deferrals and credit guarantees for the private sector. However, the slowdown in economic activity will lead to a substantial increase in monetary poverty, which is projected to reach pre-2012 levels. Given the depth of recession in 2020, a strong rebound is expected in 2021, assuming accelerated execution of public investment and improved global conditions with the roll out of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the economy is expected to stabilize at rates near those observed during the pre-crisis period. The challenge for the Peruvian economy is to accelerate GDP growth, promote shared prosperity and provide protection to its citizens against negative shocks of generalized and individual nature. To achieve this, it will be necessary to support state effectiveness to deliver public services and generate protection schemes, as well as to provide better connective infrastructure and formulate policies to reduce rigidities in factor and products markets.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, related containment measures, and a stimulus package of nearly 13 percent of GDP are taking a heavy toll on the Serbian economy, with a projected decrease in real GDP of 3 percent in 2020 and recovery starting in 2021. </p>
<p>Serbia used most of the available fiscal space early on in the pandemic, resulting in an economic contraction of 6.4 percent (year-on-year [y-o-y]) in the second quarter of 2020 that was less pronounced than in neighboring countries but still led to a small increase in unemployment and an uptick in poverty. As the economy experiences a recession and public debt sharply increases, the future fiscal space to stimulate a recovery is limited, requiring further reforms to bring the economy back to sustained growth. </p>
<p>The new government to be formed in October 2020 (following June 2020 elections) is expected to continue to implement programs that address structural weaknesses, increase public sector efficiency, and eliminate bottlenecks to private sector growth, along with maintaining macroeconomic stability. </p>
<p>An important aspect will be the introduction of a “green growth” program to its post-COVID-19 economic recovery efforts while responding to challenges that include a shrinking population, labor shortages, and climate change. Serbia's continued growth will crucially depend on the pace of the European Union (EU) accession process. </p>

        <p>A sustained period of political and institutional progress reflects a country transitioning out of fragility and protracted crisis. The 2011 Provisional Constitution, the 2012 establishment of the federal government, and the subsequent formation of four new Federal Member States are re-drawing Somalia's new federal map and creating the space for a political settlement. </p>
<p>Although key constitutional questions remain open, federalism offers a new means to negotiate power and resources, and to manage developmental imbalances between the more stable northern regions and those in the south still emerging from conflict. Somalia's private sector remains a source of resilience and innovation and political relations in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea regions are experiencing dynamic change, with potential new opportunities for Somalia to benefit from its proximity to the Ethiopian market for trade and regional integration.</p>
<p><b>Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Decision Point </b></p>
<p>Somalia reached the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/03/25/somalia-to-receive-debt-relief-under-the-enhanced-hipc-initiative"">Decision Point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative</a> on March 25, 2020, restoring the country's access to regular concessional financing and launching the process toward debt relief. It cleared its arrears to the African Development Bank (AfDB), the International Monetary Fund and the International Development Association, and reduced its external debt to $3.9 billion (78% of the revised 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) from $5.3 billion. </p>
<p>On March 31, 2020, Somalia reached agreement with the Paris Club on terms of debt relief, and it is working with remaining creditors to reach similar agreements. Somalia also resumed servicing its outstanding debt to the AfDB and IDA. To receive irrevocable debt relief, Somalia must maintain sound macroeconomic policies, implement its poverty reduction strategy—the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://mop.gov.so/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NDP-9-2020-2024.pdf"">Ninth National Development Plan (NDP9)</a>—for at least one year, and complete a set of policy measures known as Completion Point triggers that are aimed at promoting inclusive growth and poverty reduction.</p>
<p><b>Economic Development </b></p>
<p>Years of conflict and fragility have left Somalia's economy with a range of challenges, including population growth outstripping economic growth, acute poverty and vulnerability, recurrent external trade and climate shocks. Weak fiscal space and institutions, active insurgency and an incomplete political settlement have also affected the country's economic strength.</p>
<p>Somalia also has several opportunities, as the economy is transitioning from traditional, rural pastoralism to urban, trade and services. Somalia's economy has remained resilient and is realizing moderate growth despite recurrent shocks and crises, including drought and insecurity. Somalia's growth in 2019 was estimated at 2.9%, following slow recovery from a prolonged drought in 2016/17. Somalia's exposure to multiple types of shocks such as climate and water related changes, the locust infestation, conflict and insecurity and more recently, the COVID-19 global health pandemic, presents numerous challenges to a country at a nascent stage of state-building. The effects of COVID-19 are projected to have substantial headwinds on the economy, with growth downgraded from 3.2% before the onset of the health pandemic to potentially negative 2.5 to 3.0% , as consumption falls due to lower remittances and job losses, and exports of livestock decline. A shock of this magnitude is likely to result in structural changes in the economy, with potential job losses in the formal sector and informality further increasing.</p>
<p>The government is also committed to institutional reforms and reengagement with the region, including opportunities to rebuild human capital and chart a pathway toward economic resilience and growth. </p>

        <p>Yemen has been embroiled in conflict since early 2015. The poorest country in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) before the conflict escalated, now, according to the UN, it is suffering the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Fighting has devastated the economy, destroyed critical infrastructure, and led to food insecurity verging on famine. In 2020, the UN estimated 24.3 million people—80% of the population—were “at risk” of hunger and disease, of whom roughly 14.4 million were in acute need of assistance. </p>
<p>Socio-economic conditions deteriorated further in 2020, affected by low global oil prices, the economic fallout of the COVID-19 crisis, and weak public infrastructure, as well as extreme climate events and natural disasters. Distortions created by the fragmentation of institutional capacity in the Central Bank of Yemen and other government agencies, and by diverging policy decisions taken by parties to the conflict, have further compounded the crisis. Conflict has interrupted services and caused acute shortages of basic inputs, including fuel, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the economy is likely to contract from a low base in the first half of 2020. The oil sector (the only large export earner) has been hit hard by low global oil prices, and non-oil activity has suffered from the slowdown in COVID-19-related trade and from exceptionall`y heavy rainfalls, which caused intense flooding, damage to infrastructure, and human casualties.</p>
<p>An estimated 20.5 million people are without safe water and sanitation, and 19.9 million without adequate healthcare. As a result, Yemen has been grappling with mass outbreaks of preventable diseases, such as cholera, diphtheria, measles, and Dengue Fever. Waves of currency depreciations in 2018 and 2019 have created inflationary pressure that has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. Disruptions to public infrastructure and financial services have severely affected private sector activity. More than 40% of Yemeni households are estimated to have lost their primary source of income and, consequently, find it difficult to buy even the minimum amount of food. Poverty is worsening: Whereas before the crisis, it affected almost half the country's population of about 29 million, now it affects an estimated three-quarters of it—71% to 78% of Yemenis. Women are more severely affected than men.</p>
<p>Economic and social prospects, both in 2020 and beyond, are uncertain, hinging on the political and security situation. Most recently, the compounded threats of continued conflict, the spread of COVID-19, extensive flooding, and locusts have pushed the country close to catastrophe. The unaffordability of food is a threat to household welfare, as global food price increases and the depreciation of the Yemeni rial interact with COVID-19-related restrictions by food exporters. The impact desert locusts have had on crops has increased Yemen's import dependence. </p>
<p>A cessation of violence and hope for political reconciliation and the reintegration of state institutions would improve the operating environment for the private sector, and facilitate the reconstruction of the economy and rebuilding of the country's social fabric.</p>

<p>After the spread of COVID-19 in March, tight restrictions were introduced, and a full lockdown was imposed in April. However, restrictions were eased too soon in May, which led to a subsequent surge in infections. Since July, infection and fatality rates have declined, as implementation of control measures was tightened; however, both infection and fatality rates have remained among the highest in the Europe and Central Asia region.</p>
<p>Following robust growth in the past three years, which continued also in the first two months of 2020 (of more than 9 percent year-on-year [y-o-y]), growth has turned negative since March (due to the restrictions imposed as the pandemic spread) and registered a 5.7 percent y-o-y contraction for the first half of the year. Inflation remains subdued, averaging 0.8 percent for the year up to August 2020, reflecting deflation in food and world oil prices and lower aggregate demand. </p>
<p>The Government has launched 25 economic and social measures to mitigate the pandemic at an estimated cost of roughly 2.3 percent of GDP. The increased current spending, with lower revenue collection, will increase the state budget deficit from an originally planned 2.3 percent of GDP to 5.4 percent, pushing up public debt to above 60 percent of GDP.</p>

        <p>Cameroon is a lower-middle-income country with a population of over 25 million (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/country/cameroon?view=chart"">201</a>8). Located along the Atlantic Ocean, it shares its borders with Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Nigeria. Two of its border regions with Nigeria (northwest and southwest) are Anglophone, while the rest of the country is Francophone. Cameroon is endowed with rich natural resources, including oil and gas, minerals, high-value species of timber, and agricultural products, such as coffee, cotton, cocoa, maize, and cassava.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Cameroon's ruling party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), has long dominated the country's political landscape, occupying 148 of 180 seats in the National Assembly and 81 of 100 in the Senate. In November 2018, disputed election results returned President Paul Biya to office. At 85 years old, Paul Biya, who has held power since 1982, is now serving his seventh term as the country's president.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed several decades of stability, for many years now Cameroon has been grappling with attacks by Boko Haram in the Far North and a secessionist insurgency in the Anglophone regions. Since September 2017, this situation has displaced more than 500,000 people internally and claimed the lives of close to 400 civilians and over 200 military, gendarmerie, and police officers. Figures from the UN Refugee Agency (HCR) show that Cameroon is currently hosting over 401,213 refugees, primarily from the Central African Republic (289,982) and Nigeria (108,164). </p>
<p><b>Social Context</b></p>
<p>Because its poverty reduction rate is lagging behind its population growth rate, the overall number of poor in Cameroon increased by 12% to 8.1 million between 2007 and 2014, and poverty is increasingly concentrated, with 56% of poor living in the northern regions.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>Cameroon is the largest economy in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), a region experiencing an economic crisis triggered by the steep fall in oil prices. Along with its CEMAC partners, Cameroon has therefore had to put fiscal adjustment measures in place to adjust to the terms of trade shock and restore macro-stability and confidence in the common currency.</p>
<p>Growth in Cameroon is expected to reach 4.3% this year. The rebound is driven by three factors: an increase in natural gas production, with a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) offshore terminal coming online; the slight downturn in the oil sector; and sustained momentum in the construction, industry, housing, and services sectors.</p>
<p>The World Bank's <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26416/110907-WP-PUBLIC-ENGLISH-CEM-Final-US.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"">Country Economic Memorandum</a>, issued in April 2017, notes that if Cameroon is to become an upper-middle-income country by 2035, it will have to increase productivity and unleash the potential of its private sector.</p>
<p>Specifically, Cameroon's real GDP will have to grow by roughly 8% (or 5.7% per capita) between 2015 to 2035, which in turn will require the investment share of GDP to increase from about 20% in 2015 to 30% in 2035, and productivity growth to reach 2% over the same period from its average zero growth rate over the past decade. These challenges, though daunting, can be met. The public expenditure <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/five-ways-for-cameroon-to-align-public-spending-with-its-2035-vision"">review</a> published by the World Bank in February 2018 proposes five ways to achieve these goals.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>Cameroon suffers from weak governance, hindering its development and ability to attract investment. It ranks 152 out of 180 countries in the 2018 <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/lindice_de_perception_de_la_corruption_2017_met_en_avant_lampleur_du_fardea"">Transparency International</a> corruption perceptions index, and 166 out of 190 economies in the World Bank's <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.doingbusiness.org/""><i>Doing Business 2019 </i></a> report.</p>

The main pillars of its government are legality, entrepreneurship, and equity, with transversal axes in terms of infrastructure, environmental sustainability and innovation.</p>
<p>Colombia has received a massive and accelerating inflow of migrants from Venezuela. Approximately 1.8 million Venezuelans have arrived in Colombia as of December 2020, according to Colombian official statistics. Colombia has taken a leading role in adopting an open borders policy and implementing good practices in the provision of services to Venezuelan migrants and returned Colombians in areas such as education to health, services of employment and humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Colombia has a track record of prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management, anchored on an inflation targeting regime, a flexible exchange rate, and a rule-based fiscal framework, which allowed the economy to grow uninterrupted since 2000. Also, Colombia halved poverty over the past ten years.</p>
<p>However, productivity growth is low and it has actually been a drag on economic growth. A large infrastructure gap, low labor productivity, low trade integration and barriers to domestic competition are among the factors that weigh on total factor productivity. Exports are highly concentrated in non-renewable commodities (oil in particular), which increases the exposure of the economy to price shocks. Finally, Colombia is one of the countries with the highest income inequality and labor market informality in Latin America.</p>
<p>After slowing down to 1.4 percent in 2017, economic growth accelerated to 3.3 percent in 2019, driven by robust private consumption and stronger investment. Growth was on track to accelerate further in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy hard, causing a very deep recession.</p>
<p>The Government responded promptly to the crisis and took decisive actions to protect lives and livelihood, and to support the economy. On the fiscal front, the Government announced a sizable fiscal package for 2020 totaling over COP 31 trillion (or almost 3 percent of 2019 GDP), to provide additional resources for the health system, increase transfers for vulnerable groups through the expansion of existing programs and the establishment of new ones (Ingreso solidario, an unconditional cash transfer program, and VAT reimbursements for low-income segments of the population), delay tax collection in selected sectors, lower tariffs for strategic health imports, and help hard-hit firms pay employees. In addition, the government also set up special lines of credit and loan guarantees for firms in selected sectors or that have been deeply affected by the crisis, potentially totaling 72 trillion (or 6.8 percent of 2019 GDP). To ensure adequate fiscal support, the suspension clause of the fiscal rule was activated for 2020 and 2021. On the monetary front, the central bank cut its intervention rate 250 basis points between March and September and reduced it to its lowest historical level.  In addition, it introduced a broad range of measures to increase liquidity.</p>
<p>These measures are expected to mitigate the impact on the economy of COVID-19 and of the public health measures taken to contain its spread. Yet, the economy is projected to contract 7.2 percent in 2020. A rebound in growth is expected for 2021-2022, provided that the pandemic is short-lived. The low interest rate environment, facilitated by the central bank, is expected to boost private consumption growth to the extent that COVID-19 containment measures are eased. It is also expected to facilitate a gradual rebound in investment as major infrastructure projects such as the 4G road and the Bogota metro projects resume at full speed. Inflation is expected to fall towards the lower part of the central bank's targeted range, as exchange rate pass through pressures are tempered by weak demand.</p>
<p>The lower oil prices and reductions in global demand are expected to compensate the demand-driven drop in imports, while strong inflows of remittances and lower dividends to foreign direct investors are expected to cause the current account deficit to improve slightly, from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2019 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2020. A normalization of trade flows and an unfolding of backlogs of dividend payments to foreign direct investors is expected to cause the current account deficit rebound in 2021, until it stabilizes at 4.2 percent of GDP in 2022.</p>
<p>Beyond the medium-term, the outlook depends on the duration and severity of the crisis, the way and speed at which the fiscal deficit will be reduced, and the country's ability to address existing structural bottlenecks.</p>

        <p>With a surface area equivalent to that of Western Europe, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa.  While its poverty rate has fallen slightly over the past two decades, particularly in rural areas, the DRC nonetheless remains one of the poorest countries in the world. In 2018, 72% of the population, especially in the North West and Kasaï regions, was living in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 a day.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>The DRC is still recovering from a series of conflicts that broke out in the 1990s. After several postponements of the presidential elections, Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo—the son of Etienne Tshisekedi, the country's longstanding opposition leader—won the December 2018 election, succeeding Joseph Kabila who had been at the country's helm for 18 years.</p>
<p><b>Economic Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>After reaching 5.8% in 2018, economic growth <b>slowed to 4.4% in 2019</b>, owing to the drop in commodity prices, particularly for cobalt and copper, which account for over 80% of the country's exports.</li>
<li>
<b>The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)</b> is expected to trigger an economic recession (-2.2%) in 2020, stemming from weaker exports caused by the global economic downturn. However, the gradual recovery of global economic activity and the start of production at the Kamoa-Kakula mine should pave the way for a <b>rebound in economic growth to 4.5% in 2022</b>.</li>
<li>Higher spending and revenue stagnation <b>widened the fiscal deficit from close to balance in 2018 to a deficit of 2% of GDP in 2019</b>. Additional public expenditures covered mainly civil service salary increases, free basic education, and infrastructure projects. Declining tax revenues are attributable in part to low corporate income tax collection, especially in the mining sector.</li>
<li>The latest sustainability estimates show that the <b>debt risk remains moderate.</b> However, fairly weak revenues are limiting the government's flexibility to implement fiscal policies aimed at tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>
<b>The current account deficit widened to 4.2% of GDP in 2019 (against 3.6% of GDP in 2018)</b>, owing to the deterioration in the terms of trade and lower export volumes. Capital inflows and other financial flows in 2019, including foreign direct investments (FDI), have helped protect official reserves, limit the depreciation of the Congolese franc, and curb inflation.</li>
<li>Although the DRC initiated reforms aimed at strengthening governance in the management of natural resources and improving the business climate, the country is ranked 184 out of 190 countries in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/congo-dem-rep"">Doing Business 2019 </a> report on business regulations and must <b>address a host of challenges if it hopes to attract investors in key sectors</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Social Context and Development Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The DRC is making headway against the <b>Ebola</b> epidemic, which has been raging for almost two years in the Nord Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces, where 3,453 cases and over 2,200 deaths have been reported.</li>
<li>The country has also been battling the COVID-19 pandemic since March 10, 2020 and is currently implementing urgent measures to contain its spread.</li>
<li>The DRC ranks 135 out of 157 countries in terms of human capital, with a  <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital""> human capital index </a> score of 0.37%, which is below the average in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.40). This means that <b>a child born today will be 37% less productive in adulthood</b> than a child who received a complete education and proper health care. Congolese children spend an average of 9.2 years in school and <b>43% of children are malnourished</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, 43% of households have access to drinking water (69% in urban areas, 23% in rural areas) and only 20% have access to sanitation. With an average of 6.1 children per woman, the DRC's fertility rate is higher than the Sub-Saharan average (4.8). The early childbearing rate is equally high, with 125.24 births per 1,000 adolescent girls (15-19 years). </p>

        <p>The West African nation of Guinea is bordered to the north by Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Mali, and to the south by Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d'Ivoire. In 2017, the country <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/country/guinea?view=chart"">had a population</a> of 12.7 million.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>President Alpha Condé was re-elected to a second term in office with 57% of the vote in October 2015. In May 2018, President Condé announced a cabinet reshuffle and appointed Kassory Fofana prime minister. Presidential elections are scheduled for 2020.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Growth stood at around <b>10% in 2016 and 2017, before slowing to 5.8% in 2018</b>. Growth nevertheless remains robust, driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mining sector. The mining industry grew at an annual rate of roughly 50% in 2016 and 2017, while the non-mining sector posted a 5.4% growth rate in 2018, with investment in infrastructure and the expansion of the primary and tertiary sectors remaining strong.</li>
<li>
<b>Inflation</b>, which stood at 9.8% in 2018, <b>approached double-digit levels</b>, owing to an increase in fuel prices and electricity rates.</li>
<li>The <b>fiscal balance improved</b> from -2.1% of GDP in 2017 to -1.1% in 2018, owing to reduced subsidies on fuel prices, higher electricity rates, and constraints on hiring and promotions in the public sector.</li>
<li>Despite these measures, <b>tax revenue fell</b> by 0.8% of GDP to 12.5% in 2018. An extraordinary transfer of 0.4% of GDP from the Post and Telecommunications Regulatory Agency helped improve the fiscal balance.</li>
<li>With respect to expenditure, <b>investments fell</b> by 0.8% of GDP despite an increase in capital expenditure of 0.7% of GDP financed by external resources. The budget deficit was essentially financed by external resources, which was due to the fall in domestic funding.</li>
<li>The <b>risk of debt distress remains moderate</b>, even though non-concessional external borrowing increased in 2018. The total public debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 39.6% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Guinean economy continues to grapple with two main risks in 2019: the country must sustain macroeconomic and fiscal reforms and ensure social and political stability. The slow pace of infrastructure development could decelerate growth. On the external front, lower commodity prices and a global economic slowdown could undermine growth in Guinea.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>Agriculture and natural resources, as well as the manufacturing and services sectors, are some of Guinea's economic assets. Agriculture is the country's main source of employment and is critical for poverty reduction and rural development, providing income for 57% of rural households and employment for 52% of the workforce.</p>
<p>While natural conditions are favorable for growth, Guinea must improve its governance if it hopes to fully realize this potential and step up the structural transformation process. Guinea is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change, with an overall rise in average temperatures and a decline in annual rainfall, particularly in the northwestern and northeastern regions.</p>
<p>Guinea is endowed with vast natural resources, especially mining and hydropower resources, which could generate substantial income. Experience shows, however, that mining and hydropower can have serious negative effects, both direct and indirect, on biodiversity and the environment. These potential risks will require careful management.</p>
<p>Another major challenge facing Guinea are the gender gaps in the areas of education and agricultural productivity, and with regard to employment and decision-making opportunities. Taken together, these factors diminish women's prospects and undermine the country's growth trajectory. Other major constraints include weak human capital (with low literacy rates), a poor health system, a lack of quality agricultural inputs, weak sector and local government management capacity, limited access to finance, and high unemployment, especially among young people.</p>

        <p>Iran's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated at US$440 billion for the Iranian calendar year 2019/20, for a population of about 82.8 million. Iran's economy is characterized by its hydrocarbon, agricultural, and service sectors, as well as a noticeable state presence in the manufacturing and financial services. Iran ranks second in the world for natural gas reserves and fourth in proven crude oil reserves. While its economic base is relatively diversified for an oil exporting country, economic activity and government revenues still rely on oil revenues and have, therefore, been volatile. </p>
<p>The Iranian authorities have adopted a comprehensive strategy of market-based reforms in their 20-year economic vision document and sixth, 5-year development plan for the 2016/17 to 2021/22. The plan is comprised of three pillars, namely: the development of a resilient economy, progress in science and technology, and the promotion of cultural excellence. On the economic front, the development plan forecasts annual economic growth of 8%. Among the main priorities of the government during the five-year period are the reform of state-owned enterprises, financial and banking sectors, and the allocation and management of oil revenues.</p>
<p>Iran's real GDP contracted by 6.8% in 2019/20; in addition, the oil sector shrank by 38.7%. Non-oil GDP grew by 1.1%, driven by agriculture and manufacturing as exchange rate depreciation made domestic production more competitive. Expenditure-side components of 2019/20 GDP declined. The decline in GDP continued in Q1/2020/21 as COVID-19 border closures and containment measures in March and April contributed to GDP contracting by 3.5% (year-on-year), a modest contraction compared to many other countries. In contrast to past recessions, services were much more impacted; a reflection of the huge impact COVID-19 has had on service sectors around the globe. Higher government consumption expenditure in Q1 partly offset the contraction of other sectors.</p>
<p>The economic situation led to a deterioration in labor force participation and employment rates. Employment had increased by 1.8% to reach 24.3 million in 2019/20, before falling by 1.5 million (y-o-y) in Q1/2020/21 as COVID-19 led to a decline across all sectors. Labor force participation dropped by 0.4 percentage points in 2019/20 to 44.1% and, in Q1-2020/21, the labor force shrank by 1.3 million (y-o-y). Unemployment rates in 2019/20 and Q1/2020/21 fell to 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Recession and COVID-19 have made gender gaps in the labor market worse, with only 14% of (working age) women working in 2019/20, down 0.6 percentage points from the previous year.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio deteriorated in 2019/20 as oil revenues fell to 2.2% of GDP. Current expenditure grew faster, due to a higher wage bill and transfers. The government resorted to issuing bonds and selling assets to compensate for smaller oil revenues and a lower tax base. To meet its financing needs, bond issuance jumped to 6.9% of GDP, following amendments to the country's budget law. In 2020/21, the government began to sell shares in State-Owned Enterprises via the stock market and issued additional bonds through auctions held by the Central Bank of Iran.</p>
<p>The current account surplus declined as trade restrictions led to real net exports falling by 26.9%. Oil exports fell below 0.7mbpd in 2019, after the end of US sanction waivers for major importers of Iran's oil in April. Import contractions were large (38.1%) due to the rationing of foreign exchange reserves and US secondary sanctions on banking transactions related to trade with Iran. The contraction of non-oil trade accelerated to 30% (y-o-y, nominal) in April to August 2020, due to COVID-19 and expansion of the list of goods subject to import prohibition.</p>
<p>Inflationary pressures were high in 2019/20, resurging in the first five months of 2020/21 as the Iranian rial depreciated. Inflation increased by 10 percentage points to 41.2% in 2019/20, due to inflationary expectations and higher cost push factors, including higher trade costs and a sharp exchange rate depreciation of 45.7%. Inflation was led by the cost of food and household rent, disproportionately impacting low-income deciles. In tandem with the trend in the exchange rate, inflation jumped to 6.4% (month-on-month) in July 2020, a 21-month high.</p>
<p>Poverty in Iran—measuring in the World Bank's upper-middle-income threshold of US$5.5 per day (2011 PPP)—fell between 2009 and 2013 by 5 percentage points to about 8%, before increasing in 2017 to 10.9%. There are stark urban/rural differences, with much higher poverty headcount rates of about 27% in rural areas, compared to about 6% in urban areas. Inequality, measured by the Gini index in per capita expenditure, fell sharply between 2009 and 2013—from 42.0 points to 37.4 points—but increased to 40.8 points in 2017. </p>
<p>High inflation, increased gasoline prices in 2019, economic slowdown, and the economic shock caused by COVID-19 have given rise to concerns about household welfare and poverty. In the short-term, the fall in labor market incomes alone may lead to a 7-percentage point increase in poverty.  There is an expectation of regional differences in rising poverty levels, as well as the likelihood that households self-employed in the service sector, will be being more severely affected. And though government cash transfers, which were instrumental to reducing poverty during the period 2009 to 2013 can partly help compensate for lost earnings, their mitigation impact is hindered by high inflation continuing to erode the real value of the benefits. </p>
<p>The government's fiscal constraints may limit its scope for a wider response to the economic crisis, but the better targeting of cash transfers can help reduce their fiscal cost. Fiscal pressures are projected to increase because of the higher issuance of bonds and the increasing cost of COVID-19 in 2020/21. Government revenues are projected to reach a trough in 2020/21, before improving amid a moderate recovery of the economy overall. Inflationary pressure is expected to remain high due to economic uncertainty and economic recovery pressures.</p>

        <p>Kenya has made significant political, structural and economic reforms that have largely driven sustained economic growth, social development and political gains over the past decade. However, its key development challenges still include poverty, inequality, climate change, continued weak private sector investment and the vulnerability of the economy to internal and external shocks.</p>
<p>Kenya ushered in a new political and economic governance system with the passage of a new constitution in 2010 that introduced a bicameral legislative house, devolved county government, a constitutionally tenured judiciary and electoral body. The first election under this new system was held in 2013. The August 8, 2017 presidential elections were nullified on September 1, 2017 by the Supreme Court, and a new presidential election was held on October 17, 2017. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second and final five-year term on November 28, 2017. </p>
<p>In 2019, Kenya's economic growth averaged 5.7%, placing Kenya as one of the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The recent economic expansion has been boosted by a stable macroeconomic environment, positive investor confidence and a resilient services sector. </p>
<p>Kenya's economy is being hit hard through supply and demand shocks on external and domestic fronts, interrupting its recent broad-based growth path. Apart from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the locust attack which started early 2020, has affected many parts of Kenya especially the North East. It has had a negative impact on the food security and growth of the agriculture sector in the country. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to decelerate from an annual average of 5.7% (2015-2019) to 1.5% in 2020. However, if takes longer than expected to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control, GDP could contract by 1.0% in 2020, and see a delay in the projected recovery to 5.2% growth in 2021. The downside risks include a protracted global recession undermining Kenya's export, tourism and remittance inflows, further tightening of COVID-19 health response measures that disrupt the domestic economic activity, fiscal slippages and weather-related shocks. </p>
<p>World Bank support to Kenya's pandemic response includes emergency funding to strengthen medical services and reduce the spread of the virus, as well as budget support to help close the fiscal financing gap while supporting reforms that help advance the government's inclusive growth agenda. </p>
<p> In addition to aligning the country's long-term development agenda to Vision 2030,, the President outlined the “Big Four” development priority areas for his final term as President prioritizing manufacturing, universal healthcare, affordable housing and food security.</p>
<p><b>Social Development</b></p>
<p>Kenya met several of the <a href=""http://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/http:/www.worldbank.org/mdgs/"">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> targets; reduced child mortality, near universal primary school enrollment, and narrowed gender gaps in education. Interventions and increased spending on health and education are paying dividends. While the healthcare system has faced challenges recently, devolved health care and free maternal health care at all public health facilities will improve health care outcomes and develop a more equitable health care system. </p>
<p>Kenya has the potential to be one of Africa's success stories from its growing youthful population, a dynamic private sector, highly skilled workforce, improved infrastructure, a new constitution, and its pivotal role in East Africa. Addressing the challenges of poverty, inequality, governance, the skills gap between market requirements and the education curriculum, climate change, low investment and low firm productivity to achieve rapid, sustained growth rates that will transform lives of ordinary citizens, will be a major goal for Kenya.</p>

        <p><b>Malawi Context</b></p>
<p>Located in Southern Africa, Malawi is landlocked, sharing its borders with Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania. The country has an estimated population of 18.6 million (2019), which is is expected to double by 2038.</p>
<p>Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world despite making significant economic and structural reforms to sustain economic growth. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, employing nearly 80% of the population, and it is vulnerable to external shocks, particularly climatic shocks.</p>
<p>The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS), a series of five-year plans, guides the country's development. The current MGDS III, Building a Productive, Competitive and Resilient Nation, will run through 2022 and focuses on education, energy, agriculture, health and tourism. The process is underway to develop a successor plan of Vision 2020, the country's long-term development plan.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Malawi is a generally peaceful country and has had stable governments since independence in 1964. One-party rule ended in 1993; since then multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections have been held every five years.</p>
<p>Malawi's sixth tripartite elections were conducted in May 2019. The presidential results were nullified in February 2020 by the Constitutional Court. New presidential elections were held on June 23, 2020 where Lazarus Chakwera of the Malawi Congress Party and Saulos Chilima of the United Transformational Movement Party (known as the UTM Party) were elected as president and vice president respectively after getting 58.6% of the votes. They won against Peter Mutharika of Democratic Progressive Party and United Democratic Front coalition, who received 39.4% of the votes. President Lazarus Chakwera and Vice President Saulos Chilima lead a coalition of nine political parties.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>Malawi's three-year pathway of fast economic growth has been interrupted by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The full extent of the pandemic's negative impact is still uncertain as the crisis unfolds but the widespread impact of the COVID-19 crisis is expected to be felt in the fourth quarter and beyond, with reductions in tax revenue paired with increased expenditure on health and economic policy responses.</p>
<p>Malawi's economy grew by 4.4% in 2019, a marked increase from 3.5% in 2018 supported by a rebound in agriculture production, as maize and key crops apart from tobacco increased. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2020 was projected in September 2019 at 4.8% due to an expectation of the second consecutive year of strong harvests, offset by continuing political uncertainty weighing on business activity and investment. </p>
<p>Revenue and grants totaled 10.3% of GDP through December 2019, below the target of 12.2% of GDP. Total expenditure and net lending were below budgeted levels as the government spent 0.9% of GDP below the mid-year target of 14.0%, due to under-spending on development expenditure which was partially offset by recurrent expenditure overruns of 0.6 percent of GDP. </p>
<p>Repeated high fiscal deficits have contributed to an accumulation of domestic debt such that the stock of domestic debt increased from 28.2 to 29.7% of GDP between 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p><b>Social Context</b></p>
<p>Malawi has made progress in building its human capital—the knowledge, skills and health that people accumulate over their lives—in recent years. Life expectancy at birth is 63.7 years (2018 Population and Housing Census). The total fertility rate in 2015/16 was 4.4 children per woman down from 6.7 in 1992. Self-reported literacy (reading and writing in any language) is 71.6 for males and 65.9 for females (15+ years of age). </p>
<p>However, poverty and inequality remain stubbornly high. The latest poverty figures show the national poverty rate increased slightly from 50.7% in 2010 to 51.5% in 2016, but extreme national poverty decreased from 24.5% in 2010/11 to 20.1 in 2016/17. Poverty is driven by low productivity in the agriculture sector, limited opportunities in non-farm activities, volatile economic growth, rapid population growth, and limited coverage of safety net programs and targeting challenges.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>Malawi's development challenges are multi-pronged, including vulnerability to external shocks such as weather and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has further negatively impacted economic growth. Other challenges include rapid population growth and environmental degradation. Energy shortages still stand out, with about 11.4% of the population having access to electricity. Infrastructure development, the manufacturing base, and adoption of new technology are low, and corruption levels remain high with Transparency International ranking Malawi at 123/180 economies in 2019.</p>

        <p>Mali, a vast Sahelian country, has a low-income economy that is undiversified and vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations. High population growth rates (a fertility rate of six children per woman in <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN"">2017</a>) and climate change pose major risks for the country's agriculture sector and food security.</p>
<p>After rising to 47.2% between 2011 and 2015 owing to the security crisis, the extreme poverty rate fell slightly to 42.7% in 2019 as a result of exceptionally high agricultural production in the past four years. Poverty is concentrated in the rural areas of southern Mali (90%), where the population density is the highest.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Mali has been experiencing instability and conflict since the military coup of 2012 and the occupation of the northern regions by armed groups. The operations of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) date back to July 2014.</p>
<p>President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, first elected in 2013, was reelected to a second term in August 2018. Parliamentary elections scheduled for the fall of 2018 were postponed several times. The first round took place on March 29, 2020, following an electoral campaign marked by the kidnapping of Soumaïla Cissé, head of the Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) opposition party, in Saraféré on March 25, 2020. In the first round, 12 of 147 representatives were reelected. The remaining 125 seats will be awarded following the second round scheduled for April 19, 2020.</p>
<p>Peace negotiations between the government and two rebel coalitions, the “Platform” and the “Coordination,” concluded with the signing of an agreement in June 2015. This agreement provides for greater decentralization, creating a special development zone for Mali's northern regions. It includes several projects, among them the program of accelerated development in the north (<i>Programme de développement accéléré du Nord</i>) and the emergency program for the revival of development in the northern regions (<i>Programme d'urgence pour la relance du développement des régions du Nord</i>). However, the country is encountering difficulties with the implementation of this agreement.</p>
<p>Security, which is critical for economic recovery and poverty reduction, remains fragile in the face of continued attacks by armed groups on UN peacekeepers, the Malian army, and civilians, mainly in the north and central regions.</p>
<p>In July 2017, Germany, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, France, the European Union, and the United Nations Development Programme launched the Sahel Alliance in order to provide a coordinated and tailored response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since that time, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the Malian economy has, thus far, been limited. As a net oil importer, the country is benefiting from the sharp drop in the price of crude. Mali's main export item is gold, a traditional safe haven in times of crisis. Consequently, the crisis is expected to lead to an improvement in its terms of trade, which would facilitate a reduction of the current account deficit.</li>
<li>These potential positive effects must, however, be viewed in perspective, especially since Mali faces the risk of a collapse in the prices of its agricultural exports and lower demand in the Euro zone. Furthermore, if the direct effects of the slowdown in China's economic activity on Malian exports are moderate, Mali could experience importation difficulties in a situation where international value chains are disrupted.</li>
<li>Using a baseline scenario in which China and the European Union experience a modest economic downturn and oil prices decline by 25%, Mali's GDP growth is projected to fall to 4.9% in 2020, against 5.1% in 2019.</li>
<li>In a more pessimistic scenario in which oil prices decline by 50%, the global economy experiences a very sharp downturn, and the virus spreads significantly among the Malian population, the impact on the Malian economy would be far greater. Social distancing measures and the lack of medical infrastructure to cope with the health crisis would disrupt domestic economic activity, leading to a roughly 4% decline in real GDP growth.</li>
<li>Mali has the fiscal and monetary space to implement countercyclical policies. It could, however, have difficulty sustaining itself financially in a context of global uncertainty and risk aversion on the part of investors. In the short term, it would be to the government's advantage to redirect expenditure toward public health services and take steps to increase its sources of revenue, including revenue from international technical and financial partners.</li>

        <h3>Country Context</h3>
<p>Because of its size, the already high costs of developing and running national institutions are compounded by a limited capacity to exploit economies of scale in the provision of public goods and services. An EU-compatible legal framework and regulatory bodies, as well as the ability to absorb EU funds, all require substantial capacity building.Montenegro is a small, open economy aspiring to join the EU by 2025. It is also an economy vulnerable to external shocks, as it relies heavily on capital inflows from abroad to stimulate its growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, the transition to a market economy requires a reduction in the state's footprint in the economy. Creating a favorable environment for private sector development requires restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and rationalization of public spending to reduce the cost of the state.</p>
<p>Montenegro started negotiations with the EU in June 2012 and strives to join by 2025, ahead of the other countries in the Western Balkans. Of the 35 negotiations chapters, two have been provision-ally closed and 22 have been opened. In the latest European Commission (EC) Progress Report on Montenegro, the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability was stressed, noting that the rapidly rising public debt and high fiscal deficits, together with high external imbalances and high unemployment, are of particular concern.</p>
<p>Moreover, the combined effects of large-scale public infrastructure investments and several new expensive social expenditure programs challenge fiscal sustainability. </p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>A key regional player in West Africa, Nigeria accounts for about half of West Africa's population with approximately 202 million people and one of the largest populations of youth in the world. With an abundance of natural resources, it is Africa's biggest oil exporter, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.</p>
<p><b>Political context</b></p>
<p>Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and culturally diverse federation which consists of 36 autonomous states and the Federal Capital Territory. The political landscape is partly dominated by the ruling All Progressives Congress party (APC) which holds 217 out of 360 seats at the National Assembly; 64 out of 109 seats in the Senate; and 19 out of 36 State Governors.</p>
<p>Muhammadu Buhari secured a second term at the 2019 presidential elections, while the results were contested by the main opposition party the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Since 2011, the Nigerian security landscape has been consistently shaped by the war against Boko Haram terrorist group in the northern states. This adds to a lasting crisis in the oil-rich Niger Delta, where several non-state armed groups attack oil companies and state-owned pipelines.</p>
<p><b>Economic overview</b></p>
<p>Nigeria is highly vulnerable to the global economic disruption caused by COVID-19, particularly due to the pronounced decline in oil prices and spikes in risk aversion in global capital markets. Nationally, 40 percent of Nigerians (83 million people) live below the poverty line, while another 25 percent (53 million) are vulnerable. With COVID-19, many of these 53 million vulnerable people could fall into poverty. The magnitude of the health impact depends on the duration and the domestic spread of the outbreak, while the economic impact hinges on oil prices. Oil accounts for over 80 percent of exports, a third of banking sector credit, and half of government revenues. Oil prices also affect growth in non-oil industries and services, with additional pressures arising from foreign portfolio investors' reassessment of risks and domestic liquidity management.</p>
<p>The macroeconomic situation is more challenging now than in 2015-2016, when oil prices fell sharply and Nigeria experienced its first recession in 25 years. In the current situation, Nigeria has fewer buffers and policy instruments to cushion adverse effects. The Excess Crude Account is depleted, external reserves are highly reliant on short-term flows, and policy uncertainty affects investor confidence. Before the 2016 recession, Nigeria's economy was growing fast at 6.3%. By contrast, before COVID-19 struck, the economy was growing at 2.2%. Inflation was in single digits in 2014, compared to about 12% in 2019. The general government fiscal deficit was 4.4% of GDP in 2019, compared to 1.8% in 2014.</p>
<p>Unemployment and underemployment are expected to increase, affecting poor households and increasing the share of the population vulnerable to falling into poverty. Only agriculture is expected to positively contribute to growth in 2020.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>While Nigeria has made some progress in socio-economic terms in recent years, its human capital development remains weak due to under-investment. It ranked 152 of 157 countries in the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">World Bank's 2018 Human Capital Index</a>. The country continues to face massive developmental challenges, including the need to reduce the dependency on oil and diversify the economy, address insufficient infrastructure, build strong and effective institutions, as well as address governance issues and public financial management systems. These pre-existing structural challenges have left the Nigerian economy especially vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak and its consequences.</p>
<p>Inequality, in terms of income and opportunities, remains high and has adversely affected poverty reduction. The lack of job opportunities is at the core of the high poverty levels, regional inequality, and social and political unrest. Without the COVID-19 shock (the counterfactual scenario), about 2 million Nigerians were expected to fall into poverty in 2020 as population growth outpaces economic growth. With COVID-19, the recession is likely to push an additional 5 million Nigerians into poverty in 2020, bringing the total newly poor to 7 million this year.</p>

<p>The economy contracted by 4.7 percent in the second half of 2020, driven by a decline of 10.5 percent in the second quarter. The weakening of external demand from Europe, alongside pandemic-related restrictions, caused industry to contract by 14.1 percent in the first half of the year. Turnover in trade and services also decreased by 17 percent in the same time frame, but high-frequency indicators point to a relatively quick rebound.</p>
<p>The World Bank classified Romania as a high-income country for the first time, based on the 2019 data (per capita income of $12,630). This is an important development for investment rating decisions and for accession negotiations to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, Tajikistan has made steady progress in reducing poverty and growing its economy. Between 2000 and 2018, the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/infographic/2018/10/26/poverty-in-tajikistan"">poverty rate fell from 83 percent of the population to 27.4 percent,</a> while the economy grew at an average rate of 7 percent per year.</p>
<p>However, the rate of job creation has not kept pace with the growing population, leaving the economy vulnerable to external shocks, and the private sector's role in the economy remains limited, contributing to only 13 percent of formal employment and 15 percent of total investments. Non-monetary poverty indicators in rural areas remain high, as only 36 percent of the population in rural regions has access to safe drinking water. Tajikistan scores 0.53 in the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">Human Capital Index</a>, which is lower than the average for its region but higher than the average for its income group.</p>

Between 1992 and 2016, natural and climate-related disasters led to GDP losses of roughly US$1.8 billion, affecting almost 7 million people.</p>
<p>The National Development Strategy (NDS) to 2030 sets a target of increasing domestic incomes by up to 3.5 times by 2030 and reducing poverty by half. This target is achievable if Tajikistan transforms its current growth model and gives the private sector more opportunities to invest, create jobs, and contribute to the economy.</p>

        <p>Zambia is large, landlocked, resource-rich country with sparsely populated land in the center of Southern Africa. It shares its border with eight countries (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) that serve as an expanded market for its goods.</p>
<p>Zambia is experiencing a large demographic shift and is one of the world's youngest countries by median age. Its population, much of it urban, is estimated at about 17.9 million and growing rapidly at 2.8% per year, partly because of high fertility, resulting in the population doubling close to every 25 years. This trend is expected to continue as the large youth population enters reproductive age, which will put even more pressure on the demand for jobs, health care and other social services.</p>
<p><b>Economic Outlook</b></p>
<p>After 15 years of significant socio-economic progress and achieving middle-income status in 2011, Zambia's economic performance has stalled in in recent years. Between 2000 and 2014, the annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate averaged 6.8%. The GDP growth rate slowed to 3.1% per annum between 2015 and 2019, mainly attributed to falling copper prices and declines in agricultural output and hydro-electric power generation due to insufficient rains. In 2019, economic growth declined significantly, from 4% (2018) to 1.4%. The services sector remained the country's key driver of growth, growing by 3.5% in 2019, but primary and secondary sectors decreased significantly .</p>
<p>The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has exacerbated Zambia's macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The country is Africa's second largest copper producer; depressed commodity markets have pushed copper prices down by about 14% through May 2020. The supply chain breakdown in major trading partners such as China and South Africa is negatively affecting domestic production and consumption. The Kwacha has depreciated by 30% since the beginning of the year, increasing external debt servicing costs and domestic inflationary pressures. Falling revenues and increased COVID-19-related spending will worsen the 2020 fiscal position, and falling exports and capital inflows will put additional pressure on foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>As a result, the economy is projected to contract by about 4.5% in 2020. Mining and services sectors will be impacted by the global commodities demand and price outlook and increased social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The current account deficit is expected to worsen to 3.4% of GDP, while lower copper export earnings and capital inflows will put pressure on reserves and the Kwacha.</p>
<p>Domestically, increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and related social distancing measures could overwhelm the health system and result in massive business and job losses, especially in the urban informal sector.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Zambia is considered a stable country with successful democratic elections held every five years. The current President is Edgar Chagwa Lungu of the Patriotic Front Party who was re-elected in August 2016, in a closely contested presidential race with his main rival, Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development (UPND).</p>
<p>The next elections will be held in August 2021.</p>

        <p>Argentina is one of the largest economies in Latin America with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately US$450 billion.</p>
<p>Argentina has vast natural resources in energy and agriculture. Within its 2.8 million square kilometers of territory, Argentina is endowed with extraordinary fertile lands, gas and lithium reserves, and has great potential for renewable energy. It is a leading food producer with large-scale agricultural and livestock industries.  In addition, Argentina has significant opportunities in some manufacturing subsectors, and innovative services in high tech industries.</p>
<p>However, the historical volatility of economic growth and the accumulation of institutional obstacles have impeded the country's development. The COVID.-19 pandemic and social isolation as a way to combat it aggravated the situation. Urban poverty in Argentina remains high and in the first semester it reached 40,9% of population, while extreme poverty increased to 10,5% and children poverty rose  to 56,3%.</p>
<p>To deal with this situation, the country has prioritized social spending through various programs, including the Universal Child Allowance, a cash transfer program that reaches approximately 4 million children and adolescents up to age 18, 9.3% of the population.</p>
<p>After two years of recession and strong economic weaknesses, the impact of COVID-19 has been significant in Argentina. During the second quarter of 2020, the country suffered a decline in GDP of 16.2%, the largest retraction in its history.</p>
<p>To counteract the impacts of the crisis, the Government has implemented a package of emergency measures to protect the most vulnerable groups and help companies during the social isolation. This program has a  high fiscal cost, which is expected to bring the fiscal deficit in 2020 to more than 10% of GDP (the highest in more than three decades).</p>
<p>Domestic economy continues to show strong macroeconomic imbalances. Annual inflation, although it has slowed since the beginning of the year, is still above 40%, despite price controls.</p>
<p>The Government has managed to conclude the process of restructuring all its debt in foreign currency (both local and external), significantly improving the maturity profile for the next eight years. In turn, the authorities have formally begun to talk with the International Monetary Fund to agree a new program for the maturities of the Stand-By loan in the next 3 years.</p>

        <p>When the commodities boom ended, Bolivia relied on large public spending and increasing domestic credit to maintain strong economic growth despite the decline in gas export prices and volumes. These measures increased public debt and gradually reduced the macroeconomic buffers accumulated during the economic boom. Additionally, the deterioration of the international context reduced the pace of the reduction of poverty and inequality.</p>
<p>Currently, Bolivia is dealing with the global COVID-19 crisis. Officials have implemented several economic initiatives to protect the most vulnerable population, including cash transfers, the deferment of some tax payments, financial sector credits, and the partial payment of utility bills. Notwithstanding, the global economic downturn, exacerbated by the sharp drop in oil prices and social distancing measures, including a national quarantine, resulted in an economic contraction and an uptick in poverty. The economy is expected to contract by 7.3 percent in 2020, and poverty, measured with the international poverty line of 5.5 international dollars a day, is expected to increase by near nine percentage points, from 22 to 31 percent. This is partly because the country policy room was restricted by reduced macroeconomic buffers and  delays in the approval of external credits to deal with the emergency. In this context, authorities tapped into the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) to finance both the public and the financial sectors.</p>
<p>Given the health emergency, all possible mechanisms should be employed to reduce the human cost of the crisis and create an enabling environment for an economic recovery. However, the post-crisis challenges require Bolivia to consolidate macroeconomic stability by reducing its fiscal and external deficits, promote the development of private investment to diversify the economy and create quality jobs, and establish mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable and to make families more resilient to shocks.</p>

        <p>Burkina Faso is a low-income Sahelian country with limited natural resources.  Its economy is largely based on agriculture, which employs close to 80% of the working population, although gold exports have increased in recent years. Despite the progress made in the past two decades, Burkina Faso faces many development challenges, particularly in terms of health and education. It ranks 144th among 157 countries in the new human capital index  established by the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">World Bank</a> and 40.1% of the population lives below the national poverty line. Furthermore, insecurity linked to frequent terrorist attacks since 2016 has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Growing insecurity, particularly in the north, close to the border with Mali and Niger, has displaced many residents of Burkina Faso. In January 2019, fewer than 50,000 people were internally displaced, while in March 2020, this number stood at roughly 765,000.  At that time also, more than 2,000 schools were closed, a situation that deprived some 300,000 students of an education and impacted more than 11,000 teachers.</p>
<p>In July 2017, the African Development Bank, the European Union, France, Germany, the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank launched the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2018/05/31/the-sahel-alliance-working-together-to-tackle-shared-problems"">Sahel Alliance</a> with the aim of providing a coordinated and tailored response to the challenges faced by the G5 Sahel member countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Since then, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have joined the Alliance.</p>
<p>Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 2020. For the first time in the country's history, citizens of Burkina Faso in the diaspora will be able to vote from abroad.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the security and humanitarian crisis, the macroeconomic framework remained broadly stable in 2019. Although real GDP growth fell slightly, it remained <b>fairly strong at 6%, compared to 6.8 % in 2018</b>. Economic activity was led mainly by the services sector, the growth of which offset the decline in activity in the agricultural, mining, and construction sectors.</li>
<li>
<b>Inflation fell from 2% in 2018 to -3.2 % in 2019</b> owing to the combined effect of a good crop year, which led to a decline in food prices, and lower telecommunications costs.</li>
<li>
<b>The fiscal deficit improved in 2019 </b>(-2.6%), thus falling below the 3% figure stipulated in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criteria, despite the increase in security expenditure, owing mainly to higher non-tax revenue (the sale of 3G licenses) and the decline in capital expenditure resulting from the slowdown in infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Gross financing needs were covered mainly by budget assistance and the issuance of bonds on the domestic and regional markets. <b>Overall, public debt is sustainable </b>and Burkina Faso's risk of global and external debt distress continues to be moderate.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Medium-Term Projections </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Without taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic</b>, which has not yet been assessed, growth is projected to fall slightly to 5.8% in 2020, with this downward trend continuing owing to the security and humanitarian crisis. These projections will be impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, climate events, the worsening of the security and humanitarian crisis and, in the event of a global recession, the possible decline in cotton prices.</li>
<li>
<b>Inflation is expected to increase to over 2%</b>,<b> </b>as security threats could reduce the food supply. However, it is projected to remain below the 3% limit set by WAEMU.</li>
<li>The current account deficit is projected to increase but to remain fairly well controlled and stable at roughly 4.5% of GDP during the 2020-2022 period. A trade surplus of approximately 1.5% of GDP on average is expected during the same period. Three main factors will contribute to this expected surplus: the increase in gold exports, the decline in oil imports, and the consolidation of the government budget, which is expected to contribute to lower demand for imports.</li>

        <p>The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic started in Egypt in March 2020, and has since interrupted a period of macroeconomic stability, characterized by relatively high growth, improved fiscal accounts, and a comfortable level of foreign reserves. The pandemic hit as longstanding challenges continued to persist, notably the government's elevated debt-to-GDP ratio (despite its significant reduction in recent years), sluggish revenue-mobilization, and a budget structure unfavorable to the nature of the crisis, with limited allocation scheduled for key sectors such as health and education, limited job-creation in the formal sector, and the below-potential performance of non-oil merchandise exports and non-oil FDI.</p>
<p>Economic activity slowed with social distancing measures and the temporary suspension of air traffic. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined to 38.3 during the period April to June 2020, its lowest level on record, indicating a large contraction in non-oil private sector activity. The number of employed individuals declined by 2.7 million during the same period, pushing unemployment to 9.6% from 7.7% the previous quarter, with job losses, especially among informal workers, reported mainly in retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, tourism, transport and construction. </p>
<p>The government allocated an emergency response package worth LE100 billion (1.7% of GDP) to augment health expenditure, scale-up social protection, and provide financial relief for individuals and businesses. Key measures included a one-off monetary grant to irregular workers and the expansion of existing cash transfer programs. Forbearance measures were introduced in the form of delayed tax filing and loan repayments, in addition to subsidized credit for targeted sectors. The Central Bank of Egypt slashed policy rates by a cumulative 350 basis-points since March 2020 to ease liquidity. Inflation has been declining since end-2019 and has remained rather contained, registering an average of 5.7% in the fiscal year 2020 (from an average 19.6% in the previous three), reflecting subdued demand and the general decline of global commodity prices, including oil. </p>
<p>Foreign reserves dropped sharply due to large-scale capital outflows at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, in addition to the drop in tourism, Suez Canal revenues, and merchandise exports. Egypt has mobilized external financing, including a US$2.8 billion stopgap loan, issued under the IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument; a US$5.2 billion Stand-by Arrangement (of which the first US$2 billion tranche was disbursed); and a US$5 billion sovereign Eurobond, a US$0.75 billion sovereign Green-bond, and US$2 billion loan from a UAE-led commercial bank consortium. Reserves remain ample, at US$38.4 billion by the end of August 2020 (7 months of merchandise imports), albeit below its pre-crisis peak of US$45.5 billion at end-February 2020. The exchange rate depreciated marginally from LE15.7/US$1 in February 2020 to just below LE16/US$ as of August 2020, with the authorities tolerating a drain on reserves in the intervening months to absorb some of the pressure experienced by many emerging markets. </p>
<p>Growth, expected to have remained positive, declined from 5.6% in fiscal year 2019 to 3.5% in fiscal year 2020. Under a scenario that the pandemic will persist through early-2021, growth is projected to decline further to 2.3% in fiscal year 2021 before rebounding in fiscal year 2022. Private consumption in the near-term is expected to remain constrained; household incomes are affected by a combination of the economic downturn, increased joblessness, and salary cuts. Subsequently, poverty is forecast to increase, particularly in urban areas. And, since high-skilled, formal sector jobs were relatively shielded (whereas informal ones were adversely impacted by the crisis), inequality is also expected to rise. </p>
<p>While remittances may initially react countercyclically (as expats increase one-off transfers), they are expected to eventually decline, notably with the economic downturn in Gulf countries. The current account deficit is thus projected to widen before starting to improve by fiscal year 2022, especially if the expected decline in remittances outweighs the projected narrowing of the net exports deficit. On the other hand, the capital and financial account is projected to remain buoyed by foreign borrowing, although FDI may decline, exacerbating a long-standing weakness in the amount of FDI going into traded goods' sectors. </p>
<p>The recent trend in fiscal consolidation is also expected to be temporarily disrupted. The budget deficit is estimated to have widened to LE476.8 billion, equivalent to 8.2% of the projected GDP in fiscal year 2020, up from 8.1% of GDP in fiscal year 2019. This was mainly driven by the decline in the tax-to-GDP ratio and exacerbated by economic contraction and postponed tax payments. Subsequently, government debt is projected to increase (from the already elevated 90.2% of GDP at end-fiscal year 2019), before starting to moderate once again as fiscal consolidation is resumed by fiscal year 2022. The multi-dimensional health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic underscores the importance of advancing both the human capital agenda and the country's crucial need to strengthen social protection. A second wave of pending reforms, designed to unleash private sector activity and address Egypt's long-standing structural challenges, is crucial to create better employment opportunities and improve livelihoods.</p>

        <p>The smallest country in Central America, El Salvador has a population of 6.4 million (plus over 1.5 million Salvadorians living abroad) and is one of the most densely populated countries, ranking in the 83rd percentile worldwide in terms of population density.</p>
<p>GDP growth in El Salvador reached 2.3 percent in 2019, but the country has been suffering from persistently low levels of economic growth. Annual GDP growth has exceeded 3 percent only twice since 2000 and averaged just 2.3 percent in recent years.</p>
<p>The country had recently registered a moderate <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/SLV"">poverty</a> reduction. The poverty rate (based on a US$5.5 per person per day poverty line) <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/poverty/33EF03BB-9722-4AE2-ABC7-AA2972D68AFE/Global_POVEQ_SLV.pdf"">declined</a> from 39 percent in 2007 to 29 percent in 2017. Extreme poverty (US$3.2 per person per day) also declined from 15 percent to 8.5 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>El Salvador also became a more equal country in recent years, with the second-highest level of equality in Latin America and the Caribbean, after Uruguay, on par with the world average. Inequality –measured by the Gini coefficient– declined from 0.51 in 2001 to 0.38 in 2018.</p>
<p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant negative impact, even though El Salvador was the fastest country in Central America to adopt strong containment measures against the outbreak and remains among the least affected in the region.</p>
<p>The Government also took steps to limit the pandemic's impact on households and businesses. Measures included cash transfers to approximately 60 percent of all households; food distribution for low-income households; payment deferrals for basic utilities, mortgages and personal loans; extensions on income tax payments for individuals and applicable firms; lowering banks' reserve requirements for newly issued loans, and the temporary relaxation of lending conditions through a grace period for loan repayments, among others. The Government also invested in strengthening the capacity of the public health system, renewed various health care centers and built a new hospital specializing in COVID-19 treatment.</p>
<p>The pandemic will negatively impact poverty reduction and economic growth, as El Salvador's GDP is expected to contract by 8.7 percent in 2020, due to diminished economic activity, decreased aggregate demand in international markets and a reduction in remittances sent to households mainly from the United States. An economic growth of 4.9 percent is expected in 2021.</p>
<p>Crime and violence also threaten social development and economic growth in El Salvador and are among the main factors driving Salvadorians to migrate. Nevertheless, murder rates have declined dramatically since August 2019, bringing the country's violence indicators towards the regional average.</p>
<p>El Salvador has also a high exposure to natural hazards, including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It is also highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including more frequent occurrences of floods, droughts, and tropical storms.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, El Salvador has great potential to bolster its economic growth. The country's strategic location, with access to many markets, a growing labor force, and a solid industrial base could support the expansion of the trade sector to achieve stronger and more inclusive growth. Development goals could be achieved with a long-term commitment to structural reform, quality job creation and investment in human capital.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p><b>Economy</b></p>
<p>Eritrea's recent growth performance has been marked by significant volatility in part due to its dependence on a predominantly rain-fed agriculture sector, accounting for about one-third of the economy (and which has a significant impact on distribution services which account for around 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), and on a narrow mining sector which also accounts for 20% of the economy. Real GDP growth is estimated to have recovered to around 12% in 2018, while averaging -2.7% during 2015-18 on account of frequent droughts and a decline in mining production.  </p>
<p>Reported inflation has been negative during 2016-18, following the exchange of currency in circulation in November 2015 that resulted in a monetary contraction. Deflation continued in 2018 as increased trade with Ethiopia resulted in further put downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>In recent years, Eritrea has significantly tightened fiscal policy to reverse the chronic deficits it suffered after the increase in regional insecurity in 1998. In 2018, the fiscal surplus widened to around 11% of GDP in 2018. This was largely achieved by a sharp drop in capital spending as well as some revenue measures. However, fiscal pressures, both recurrent and wage-related are likely to mount.</p>
<p>Short-term growth prospects remain challenging given fiscal constraints and limited opportunities under existing restrictions. The recovery in agriculture is expected to slow. The country remains in a difficult macroeconomic situation with an unsustainable debt burden (including arrears to the World Bank) and vulnerable financial and external sectors.</p>
<p>However, the economic outlook is potentially favorable in the medium term, reflecting the new mining operations coming on stream, but are also dependent on measures to relax restrictions on the private sector imposed and to reopen access to concessional development finance. </p>
<p>Poverty appears to have remained widespread in Eritrea, but the lack of data limits available quantitative evidence. The most recent available survey data from 1996/97 indicate a 70% poverty rate.</p>
<p>The country has seen consistent improvements in life expectancy (rising from 50 years in 1990 to 65 years in 2015) and expected years of schooling (from 3.8 years in 1995 to 5.4 years in 2010) and strong social outcomes in the face of limited resources.    </p>
<p>Nevertheless, challenges remain. An unfinished maternal and child health agenda is compounded by a significant rise in Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs). Skilled birth attendance remains low, between 35-60%, maternal mortality ratio high at 485 deaths per 100,000 live births and under-five malnutrition also high with 52% of children underweight.</p>
<p><b>Political Background</b></p>
<p>Eritrea is small, coastal country strategically located along the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa, bordered by Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Eritrea is divided into six administrative regions called ‘zobas', which vary in size, population and socioeconomic conditions. </p>
<p>After a long liberation war, Eritrea regained self-rule in 1991 and full independence in 1993. The country enjoyed seven years of stabilization, reconstruction and development, before the onset of a border war with Ethiopia in 1998. The brunt of hostilities ended in 2000 and a UN Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) ruled in favor of Eritrea in 2002, but the border zone remained militarized, UN Security Council sanctions were imposed in 2009 and reinforced in 2011. Eritrea remained in a state of mobilization for almost two decades under transitional political arrangements focused on national security with a suspension of traditional checks and balances. The earlier development model was eschewed in favor of greater self-reliance and a more state-led planned economy.  </p>
<p>Management of national resources – labor, land, and finance – was geared toward maintaining a state of military readiness, alongside efforts to broaden social equity. The private sector was gradually replaced by an extensive state sector geared to marshal scarce resources and increasing restrictions were imposed. An institutional framework developed to direct labor into an indefinite military and national service. The resulting austerity and extensive controls spurred migration of people and capital.</p>
<p>In mid-2018, Eritrea experienced a turnaround in its external environment.   Ethiopia accepted the EEBC decision and signed a peace treaty with Eritrea in July 2018. Eritrea began to normalize relations with neighboring countries. In November 2018, UN Security Council lifted its sanctions on Eritrea. This raised expectations of a reorientation of Eritrean political and economic arrangements have been met with caution from the administration, as evidenced by President Isaias' recent call for a “patient appraisal of the unfolding reality.” </p>

<p>Georgia's strong record of economic reforms and improved living standards is being threatened by the impact of COVID-19. The country's economy grew robustly at 5.3 percent per annum between 2005 and 2019, despite major shocks. Poverty declined from 30 percent in 2005 to 14 percent in 2019 (using the US$3.20 purchasing power parity [PPP] 2011 international poverty line). The COVID-19 pandemic, however, will reverse some of these past gains. The country is expected to slip into a deep recession in 2020 (a 6 percent contraction), with severe job and income losses, which could push poverty up by 2.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>The country has a sound macroeconomic framework, an attractive business environment, and robust public financial management arrangements that are expected to support the post-COVID recovery. Georgia's governance indicators typically exceed Europe and Central Asia and upper-middle-income country averages (World Governance Indicators). The country also remains one of the most business friendly countries globally, placing seventh out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 rankings.</p>
<p>The country has a shared consensus on national priorities, including participation in Euro-Atlantic integration, more efficient government, stronger growth, and a better functioning welfare state. This has paved the way for the signing of an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) in 2016, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area preferential trade regime. The latest progress report, adopted by the European Parliament on September 17, 2020, confirmed Georgia's continued progress on the implementation of the agreement. Free trade agreements with major trade partners, such as the EU and China, position Georgia well to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>

        <p>Guatemala has experienced economic stability due to a combination of prudent fiscal management, inflation targeting, and a managed floating exchange rate. The Guatemalan economy -<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=GT-PA-HN-CR-SV-NI"">the largest in Central America</a>- has also had a solid performance, although with moderate growth rates of 3.5 % on average in the last five years.</p>
<p>This economic stability, however, has not translated to a significant reduction in poverty and inequality. Measured by its GDP per capita (US$ 4,549 in 2018), Guatemala is the fifth poorest economy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), with persistently high rates of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/GTM"">poverty and inequality</a>.</p>
<p>Guatemala also has the sixth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in LAC. Chronic childhood malnutrition (and stunting) affects 47 % of all children under the age of five, 58 % of indigenous children, and 66 % of children in the lowest income quintile. In 2019, Guatemala ranked 68th in food security out of 113 countries, with only 40 % of Guatemalan families enjoying food security.</p>
<p>Low central government revenues (11 % of GDP on average in recent years and an estimated 9.7 % in 2019) limit capacities for public investments and restrict both the quality and coverage of basic public services, from education and health to access to water. This, in turn, perpetuates a lack of incentive in the economy for formality and tax paying.</p>
<p>Disrupting billions of lives and livelihoods in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens decades of hard-won development gains. In a more moderate scenario, the global economy could shrink by 5.2 % in 2020 before rebounding in 2021; in a more negative scenario of prolonged shutdowns, world output could contract by almost 8 % in 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic has affected the Guatemalan economy considerably —it is expected to contract by 3 % in 2020—, leading to substantial adverse social effects and worsened existing vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul><li>Firms, particularly MSMEs, providing more than 90 % of private jobs, have been affected significantly due to lockdown measures, falling demand, bottlenecks in supply chains and drying liquidity as revenues collapse.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Jobs losses are expected to be highest in construction, services, transport and commerce, where most of the vulnerable workforce is concentrated, and where female employment is also most prominent.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The incomes of the self-employed (around 40 % of the labor force), temporary workers and workers in affected sectors (e.g., tourism and entertainment) will slump.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The recession in the U.S. could affect exports and remittance inflows, the largest two sources of foreign exchange earnings, and exacerbate the private consumption slowdown.</li></ul>
<p>Approximately one million people are expected to fall into poverty, raising the country's poverty rate by as much as 6 percentage points, depending on the depth and duration of the crisis as well as the speed of the economic recovery.</p>
<p>Additionally, Guatemala is extremely affected by climate and weather events and its poorer populations are particularly vulnerable. Guatemala ranks ninth in the world for level of risk to the effects of climate change.</p>

        <p>Lesotho is a small, mountainous, and landlocked country, surrounded by its much larger neighbor, South Africa. It has a population of about two million, and nominal per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $1,299.</p>
<p>Lesotho is classified as a lower-middle-income country. It is mostly highlands, with its lowest point 1,400 meters above sea level. Previously a British protectorate, the nation gained its independence in October 4, 1966. A constitutional monarchy, Lesotho is ruled by a king as Head of State, and the Prime Minister as Head of Government, governed by a 33-member Senate and a 120-member National Assembly. Elections were held in June 2017 for the third time in five years, leading to the formation of a four-party coalition government, led by Prime Minister Thomas Thabane.</p>
<p>In keeping with recommendations made by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the government is currently undertaking key constitutional, security, parliamentary, judicial, public sector, economic and media sector reforms.  </p>
<p><b>Economic growth</b></p>
<p>In recent years, Lesotho's economic performance has been negatively affected by sluggish global economic growth amid a major downturn in both emerging markets and advanced economies. Furthermore, sustained political instability in the country, coupled with slow economic growth in the South African economy, also contributed to slow economic performance. Real GDP growth rate is estimated to have averaged 1.6% between 2015–2019 and it is projected to average 0.6% between 2019–2021, largely attributed to the expected negative impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus).<br><br> In the medium-term, economic growth is expected to be boosted by construction-related projects including construction works associated with the second phase of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lhda.org.ls/lhdaweb/projectphases/phaseii"">Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP II</a>), the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P160672"">Lesotho Lowlands Water Development Projects</a> (LLWDP -I and-II), and government roads. The water and electricity subsectors are expected to be boosted by green energy projects, while the tertiary sector is envisaged to be supported <i>inter alia</i> by government initiatives to reinforce financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Unemployment remains high at 23.6% in 2018 coupled with high inequality and poverty. The national poverty rate declined from 56.6% in 2002 to 49.7% in 2017. Urban areas registered strong poverty reduction of 13 percentage points, while rural areas poverty rates levels decreased marginally by 0.6 percentage points, leading to wider urban-rural inequality.</p>
<p>Over the same period, extreme poverty declined from 34.1 to 24.1% while the poverty gap declined from 29.0% to 21.9% leading to a lower Gini coefficient, hence the narrowing in the income inequality in the country. As such, Lesotho is more equal than its neighbors, with a Gini coefficient of 44.6. However, it remains one of the 20% most unequal countries in the world.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges and Risks</b></p>
<p>COVID–19 poses some challenges to global health systems as well as social and economic prospects at large. This has spillover effects onto Lesotho by way of slower economic activities and risks to vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Lesotho's economy is significantly open to global trade.COVID-19 is expected to impact supply chains, thus hampering trade, as most textiles and apparel firms in Lesotho source raw materials from China, which is the epicenter of the COVID-19. Furthermore, commodity exports to major economies such as Euro Area and the United States are most likely to be negatively affected. The tourism sector is also expected to be negatively affected by the advent of COVID-19.</p>
<p>High HIV/AIDS prevalence and tuberculosis remain Lesotho's greatest health challenge. The HIV prevalence rate in Lesotho is 25% percent in the adult population (15-49 years), the second highest in the world. The incidence of TB stands at 611 cases per 100,000, according to the World Health Organization's Global TB report 2019. While high health costs exert more pressure to the fiscal burden, high HIV/AIDS and TB rates continue to contribute to persistently high inequality and poverty. </p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Located off the southeast coast of Africa, neighboring the French island of La Reunion, Mauritius is an island state of about 1.3 million people. The country's economy has made great strides since independence in 1968, and is now classified as a high-income country. Key challenges include managing the transition to a knowledge-based economy and adapting to the impacts of climate change. </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>Mauritius is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Shifting coalitions are a feature of politics in the country. The President is the head of state, while the Prime Minister has full executive powers and heads the government. General elections were held November 7, 2019. The result was a victory for the Mauritian Alliance (a coalition of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), Muvman Liberater, Alan Ganoo Movement and Plateforme Militante), which won 42 of the 70 seats. Pravind Jugnauth of the MSM remained Prime Minister. </p>
<p><b>Recent Economic Developments </b></p>
<p>The country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 grew 3.6%, driven by construction and services sectors (banking, ICT) as well as a rebound in agriculture. Manufacturing growth remained on a sluggish trend and was negatively impacted by decelerating global demand during 2019. This continued a pattern of structural transformation, with more knowledge intensive services sectors expanding while some of the sectors that have traditionally provided low-skilled employment stagnating or contracting. Based on its 2019 data, Mauritius was classified as a high-income country by the World Bank for the first time in July 2020.  </p>
<p>The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is severely affecting the country's economy through a standstill in tourist arrivals, crumbling export demand in particular for its garment sector, and the temporary lockdown measures adopted in April, May and June. While the spread of COVID-19 in the country was effectively stopped in April with no new domestic cases as of July 2020, GDP is expected to contract in double digits. The government put in place a support package to help the private sector cope with the shock, which mitigated the impact on employment, while in combination with declining revenue leading to a large deficit for the fiscal year 2019/20. </p>
<p><b>Development Challenges </b></p>
<p>Mauritius faces the challenge of managing its transition to a knowledge-based economy, driven by innovation and productivity growth. This will require a concerted effort to remove bottlenecks to new sources of growth and private investment, such as a lack of connectivity, skills shortages, and misaligned incentives that will also be critical for its recovery from the COVID-19 induced recession. </p>
<p>While the trend may have recently been reversed, inequality has been on the rise for a number of years. Public transfers have contributed to mitigate the rise in total income inequality. While general unemployment was low pre-COVID-19 (6.9% in Q1 2020), women face a higher unemployment rate at 9.8%, and a much lower labor force participation rate.  </p>
<p>Mauritius is highly vulnerable to tropical storms and the risk is amplified by climate change. A multi-hazard risk assessment completed in 2017 suggests that Mauritius experiences on average $110 million per year in direct losses from tropical cyclones and floods. Each year, there is a 1% chance of losses exceeding $1.9 billion, or 16% of Mauritius' GDP. Mauritius lies within the cyclone area of the Indian Ocean. A large share of the population and productive assets in Mauritius are exposed to multiple risks from cyclones. Flood risk is continuously increasing. The frequency of storms of tropical cyclone strength (winds above 165 km/h) has increased significantly over the past three decades. </p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Myanmar is a nation in transition, seeking to break with a past marred by authoritarian rule, economic mismanagement, and multiple conflicts that persist today, driven by social exclusion and predatory natural resource extraction. The country's opening, in 2011, and the first democratic elections, in 2015, marked critical turning points for Myanmar, generating a wave of optimism. Unification of exchange rates, initial liberalization of product and factor markets, integration into regional markets, and modernization of economic and financial institutions and systems resulted in rapid economic growth (above 7 percent per year) and measurable improvements in social welfare since 2011. Poverty almost halved, falling from 48 percent to 25 percent between 2005 and 2017.</p>
<p>Reform momentum slowed after 2016 as a newly elected civilian government grappled with defining its economic vision and managing the public administration to implement policies and programs. Most recently, the Government adopted an ambitious Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan, reinvigorated its economic reform agenda, and has gradually begun to tackle the more difficult second-generation reforms needed to sustain the economic transition. The second democratic national elections are scheduled for November 2020.</p>
<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic growth in Myanmar was projected to pick up to 6.3 percent in FY2019/20 and 6.4 percent in FY2020/21. However, Myanmar's economy is now expected to decline sharply due to direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. The global shock and domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus have had a substantial economic cost. And, initially numbers of known COVID-19 positive cases were relatively low but see since mid-August 2020 a sharp rise.</p>
<p>Economic growth in a baseline scenario is projected to drop from 6.8 percent in <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/06/25/myanmars-economy-severely-impacted-by-covid-19-report"">FY18/19 to just 0.5 percent in FY2019/20</a>. If the pandemic is protracted, the economy could contract by as much as 2.5 percent in FY2019/20, with the expected recovery in 2020/21 subject to further downside risks.</p>
<p>The slowing economic growth threatens to partially reverse Myanmar's recent progress in poverty reduction while reducing the incomes of households that are already poor.</p>
<p>Under the baseline scenario, in which the domestic spread of the coronavirus is brought under control, the global economy swiftly recovers, and Myanmar's GDP growth rate is projected to bounce back to 7.2 percent in FY2020/21, poverty rates would increase in the short term and will not return to pre-crisis levels FY2021/22. Under the downside scenario, poverty rates would remain above their pre-crisis level until at least FY2022/23.</p>
<p>As in other countries, exclusion in Myanmar occurs along many lines including gender, ethnicity, and citizenship. This—coupled with widespread underdevelopment and weak service delivery<a name=""OLE_LINK1"" id=""OLE_LINK1""></a>—means that human capital is particularly limited in Myanmar. Unless Myanmar invests in all its people it will not be able to maximize economic growth, undermining prosperity not just for the excluded, but for everybody. There is a two-way association: broadly shared economic opportunities are needed to reinforce durable peace, but progress is needed for peace and civil liberties to offer economic opportunities to all and maximize growth and shared prosperity in Myanmar.</p>
<p>The crisis in Rakhine State, together with intensified conflict in other states, poses a serious threat to Myanmar's goal of becoming ‘a peaceful and prosperous' nation.  Since the tragic events of 2017, the World Bank Group (WBG) has engaged in a profound reflection on how best to respond to Myanmar's recurring conflict and violence.  This has involved analysis of the drivers of exclusion and conflict and on social inclusion within the WBG program.  On this basis, the WBG adjusted its strategy, redesigned its planned pipeline and introduced new operations focused specifically on social inclusion in conflict areas.</p>
<p>Climate change is another major challenge for the development of Myanmar. It is one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, exposed to multiple hazards, including floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides and droughts. Along with Puerto Rico and Honduras, Myanmar is one of three countries most affected by climate change in the period 1999-2018 according to the <a href=""https://germanwatch.org/en/17307"">2020 Global Climate Risk Index</a> and 19<sup>th</sup> out of 191 countries on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index"">INFORM Index for Risk Management</a>.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p style=""text-align: left;"">Pakistan's real GDP growth is estimated to have declined from 1.9 percent in FY19 to -1.5 percent in FY20. The first contraction in decades, this reflects the effects of COVID-19 containment measures that followed monetary and fiscal tightening prior to the outbreak. To curtail the spread of the pandemic, a partial lockdown – that included restrictions on air travel, inner-city public transport, religious/social gatherings and the closure of all schools and non-essential businesses – was imposed in March, and gradually eased from May 2020 onwards. This disrupted domestic supply and demand, as businesses were unable to operate and consumers curbed expenditures, which specifically affected services and industries. The services sector is estimated to have contracted, by over 1 percent, while industrial production is expected to have declined even more, due to the high policy rates prior to the pandemic and plunging domestic and global demand thereafter. The agriculture sector, partially insulated from the effects of the containment measures, is estimated to have expanded modestly over the year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">On the demand side, private consumption is estimated to have contracted in FY20, as households reduced consumption amid the lockdown and dimmer employment prospects. Similarly, with heightened uncertainty, disrupted supply chains and a global slowdown, investment is estimated to have fallen drastically. Exports and imports also shrank given weaknesses in global trade and domestic demand. In contrast, government consumption growth rose, reflecting the rollout of the fiscal stimulus package to cushion the effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Despite weak activity, consumer price inflation rose from an average of 6.8 percent in FY19 to an average of 10.7 percent in FY20, due to surging food inflation, hikes in administered energy prices, and a weaker rupee, which depreciated 13.8 percent against the U.S. dollar in FY20. With elevated inflationary pressures, the policy rate was held at 13.25 percent from July to February but was subsequently lowered to 7.0 percent over the remainder of FY20 to support dwindling activity and as inflationary expectations fell amid the pandemic. The central bank also implemented multiple measures to provide liquidity support to firms. At end-FY20, the banking system remained well capitalized, though upticks in non-performing loans were beginning to erode capital buffers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The current account deficit shrunk from 4.8 percent of GDP in FY19 to 1.1 percent of GDP in FY20, the narrowest since FY15, driven mainly by import values falling 19.3 percent. Total export values also contracted 7.5 percent due to weak global demand. Despite the global downturn, workers' remittances increased relative to FY19, underpinning a wider income account surplus. Meanwhile, higher net foreign direct investment, and multilateral and bilateral disbursements, more than offset a decline in portfolio flows, leading to a larger financial account surplus. The balance of payments consequently swung to a surplus of 2.0 percent of GDP in FY20, and official foreign reserves increased to US$13.7 billion at end-June 2020, sufficient to finance 3.2 months of imports.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In FY20, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 8.1 percent of GDP from 9.0 percent in FY19. Total revenues rose to 15.3 percent of GDP due to higher non-tax revenue, as the central bank and the telecommunication authority repatriated large profits. Despite reforms, tax revenues slipped to 11.6 percent of GDP, with lower economic activity and larger tax expenditures. Expenditures rose mainly due to a fiscal stimulus package valued at around 2.9 percent of GDP, while the public debt, including guaranteed debt, increased to 93.0 percent of GDP by end-FY20.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">While domestic economic activity is expected to recover, as lockdown measures are lifted and base effects materialize, Pakistan's near-term economic prospects are subdued. Significant uncertainty over the evolution of the pandemic and availability of a vaccine, demand compression measures to curb imbalances, along with unfavorable external conditions, all weigh on the outlook. Economic growth is projected to remain below potential, averaging 1.3 percent for FY21-22. This baseline projection, which is highly uncertain, is predicated on the absence of significant infection flare ups or subsequent waves that would require further widespread lockdowns. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The current account deficit is expected to widen to an average of 1.5 percent of GDP over FY21-22, with imports and exports gradually picking up as domestic demand and global conditions improve. The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 7.4 percent in FY22, with the resumption of fiscal consolidation and stronger revenues driven by recovering economic activity and structural reform dividends. Expenditures will remain substantial due to sizeable interest payments and defense expenditures, a rising salary and pension bill, and absorption of energy SOE guaranteed debt by the government.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">There are considerable downside risks to the outlook with the most significant being a resurgence of the COVID-19 infection, triggering a new wave of global and/or domestic lockdowns and further delaying the implementation of critical IMF-EFF structural reforms (slated to resume in H1-FY21). Locust attacks and heavy monsoon rains could lead to widespread crop damage, food insecurity and inflationary pressures. Livelihoods for households dependent primarily on agriculture could also be negatively impacted. Finally, external financing risks could be compounded by difficulties in rolling-over bilateral debt from non-traditional donors and tighter international financing conditions.</p>

        <p>The Republic of Seychelles lies northeast of Madagascar, an archipelago of 115 islands with almost 98,000 citizens, three-quarters of whom live on the main island of Mahé. Seychelles has the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Africa, at nearly $17 billion (2019), but inequality is significant, placing the prospect of continued shared prosperity in tighter focus. Climate change also poses long-term sustainability risks. </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>Independent since 1976, the Seychelles is a relatively young democracy: the first multiparty presidential election was held in 1993 after the adoption of a new constitution. A presidential election in December 2015 was closely-fought, and President James Michel narrowly elected for a third and last term by just 193 votes out of the 62,831 valid votes cast. Michel resigned in October 2016, and was replaced by his deputy, Danny Faure. In September 2016's legislative elections the opposition coalition won the parliamentary elections for the first time. Presidential and parliamentary elections are schedule for October 2020.  </p>
<p><b>Economic developments and outlook </b></p>
<p>Following the economic crisis and resulting sovereign debt default in 2008, the Republic of Seychelles through a prudent reform program made significant progress in achieving economic stability and fiscal sustainability. As a result, the economy grew by an average rate of 4.2% per annum between 2009 and 2019. With the help of an International Monetary Fund program, the government maintained its target of 2.5% primary balance and was on target to reduce the debt to GDP ratio to 50% by 2021. Prudent monetary policy also led to a build-up of the gross international reserves to 3.5 months of import coverage by 2019 from less than one month at end-2008. </p>
<p>The economic and social shock from COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the Seychellois economy is severe due to strong dependence on international tourism. Tourism accounts for approximately 30% of gross domestic product (GDP), making the country highly vulnerable to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global outbreak is drastically reducing economic activity in 2020 as tourist arrivals are projected to decline by more than 50%. This is affecting other sectors such as transportation; art, recreation and entertainment; wholesale and retail trade; and the financial and insurance sector. GDP is expected to contract by 15.9% in 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic projected growth rate of 3.5%. Recovery is expected to begin in 2021 with a projected increase of 4.7% driven by a recovery in the tourist industry and a resumption in capital flows. If unmitigated, the poor are expected to bear a disproportionate impact of the economic shock. According to the 2013 household survey, about 6 out of 10 poor individual have a job, mostly in informal activities in the service sector that are expected to experience significant declines.   </p>
<p><b>Development challenges </b></p>
<p>While the immediate priority is the containment of COVID-19 and recovery from its economic and social impact on the country, a focus on longer term structural issues is also warranted for a strong and resilient recovery.   </p>
<p>Among Seychelles' development challenges is the importance to focus on greater productivity, participation and performance of its economy as means to increasing shared prosperity. Some of the main institutional challenges in this regard are notably barriers to open and operate businesses, inefficiencies in public sector management, such as limited statistical capacity, scope for a more strategic and sustainable approach to social protection, as well as the need to broaden access to quality education and skills development. Climate change adaptation, including through strengthened disaster preparedness systems and enhanced coastal management, is also key.  </p>

        <p>Now moving into its tenth year, the conflict in Syria has inflicted an almost unimaginable degree of devastation and loss on the Syrian people and their economy. More than 400,000 deaths have been directly attributed to the conflict so far, with millions more non-lethal casualties known to have occurred. More than half the country's pre-conflict population (of almost 21 million) has been displaced—one of the largest displacements of people since World War II—and, partly as a result, by 2017, economic activity in Syria had shrunk by more than 60% compared to what it had been in 2010. </p>
<p>The social and economic impact of the conflict is also large—and growing. A lack of sustained access to health care, education, housing, and food have exacerbated the effects of the conflict and pushed millions of people into unemployment and poverty. With a severely degraded healthcare system, Syrians remain extremely vulnerable to additional shocks, such as the COVID-19 outbreak still unfolding.</p>
<p>In addition, a deepening economic and political crisis in neighboring Lebanon and the introduction of the Caesar Law have further restrained Syria's external economic ties, leading to fuel shortages, price hikes, and a rapid depreciation in local currency.</p>
<p><b>Assessing the Impact of the Syrian Crisis </b></p>
<p>Prior to the conflict, the World Bank Group provided support to Syria through its technical assistance and advisory services on private sector development, human development, social protection, and environmental sustainability. Following the onset of the conflict in 2011, all World Bank operational activity and missions to Syria were halted. Nonetheless, the World Bank monitors the impact of the conflict on the Syrian people and the economy in consultation with other members of the international community. This helps inform international thinking on Syria from an economic and social perspective and build preparedness for post-agreement recovery efforts, when and if mandated. </p>
<p>In 2017, the World Bank produced two reports on the impact of the Syrian conflict: (i) a Damage Assessment of Aleppo, Idlib, and Hama, and (ii) an Economic and Social Impact Analysis of the conflict in Syria, called the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/syria/publication/the-toll-of-war-the-economic-and-social-consequences-of-the-conflict-in-syria"" target=""_blank"">Toll of War</a>. Accordingly, from 2011 to 2016, cumulative GDP losses were estimated at US$226 billion. The second study also found that losses caused by the conflict's disruption of the economy exceeded those losses caused by physical destruction by a factor of 20. The longer the conflict lasts, the more difficult recovery will be, as these losses become more persistent over time. </p>
<p><b>Analyzing the Drivers of Syrian Refugees' Spontaneous Returns</b></p>
<p>The World Bank's analytical work program focuses on analyzing policy questions on the Syrian conflict. <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/syria/publication/the-mobility-of-displaced-syrians-an-economic-and-social-analysis"">The Mobility of Displaced Syrians</a> (February 2019) tackled the complex problem of refugee returns. With UNHCR support, the report compared the characteristics of more than 100,000 Syrians UNHCR verified to have returned spontaneously between 2015 and mid-2018, to those of millions of others who did not return in the same period. In explaining their patterns of return, the report analyzed the roles played by the individual economic, social, and demographic characteristics of these groups, as well as the conditions they faced in host countries and the conditions in the places where they were from in Syria. This involved considering both what refugees said (survey responses) and what they did (actual return decisions). </p>
<p>Results showed that refugees face a difficult trade-off between living in a secure area and maintaining their quality of life. For instance, when it came to the war's impact on school-going children, the school attendance ratio of Syrian children remained higher in Syria than it did in Lebanon or Jordan, mainly because many Syrian refugees had to adopt adverse coping strategies in their countries of asylum; Syrian girls dropped out of school to get married at a younger age and Syrian boys dropped out to bring extra income for their families' survival. For these children, human capital accumulation stops when they leave school, with persistent effects on their lifetime well-being. </p>
<p>Nor did improving the conditions of refugees necessarily deter their return: refugees given one more meal per day were 15% more likely to return to Syria than others without. The best results—not only in terms of return but also in regard to the welfare of refugees, their hosts, and Syrians in Syria—was achieved when diversified policy tools were used, including assistance when returning home, service restoration, and support for host communities. </p>
<p><b>Mitigating the Regional Fallout of the Syrian Conflict </b></p>
<p>In June 2020, the World Bank released a Regional Economic and Social Impact Assessment, titled <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/mena/publication/fallout-of-war-in-syria"">The Fallout of War</a>, which analyzed the impact of the Syrian conflict on the Mashreq region quantitatively, and identified ways in which it had been manifested. The assessment concluded that the Syrian conflict broke down bilateral and transit trade routes, destabilized the region, and led to the largest displacement crisis since the Second World War. As a result, Syria's neighbors faced the combination of a decrease in economic activity, deterioration in labor markets, and increase in poverty that would have overwhelmed even the world's most advanced economies.</p>
<p>The analysis also suggested that a number of persistent structural weaknesses in the region, including low or deteriorating institutional resilience, reduced the effectiveness of the mitigation policies put into place to deal with the impact of the Syrian crisis. Short-termism in policymaking propagated the shocks caused by the Syrian conflict, leading to costly and ineffective services, lost economic opportunities, and underfunded programs. The report advocated a fundamental shift from short-term mitigation policies to a medium-term regional strategy that would address structural problems. As countries in the Mashreq look toward recovery, policies are needed that take into account the region's interconnectedness and seek to provide better prospects for people.

<p>In addition to producing analytical products that inform policies, the World Bank also collaborates with a wide range of partners and international financial institutions to help Syrian refugees and their regional hosts. T<a href=""https://globalcff.org/"" target=""_blank"">he Global Concessional Financing Facility</a> offers middle-income countries with large numbers of refugees favorable financing terms for development by combining grants from donors with loans from Multilateral Development Banks. To date, the World Bank has supported over US$3 billion worth of projects in Jordan and Lebanon (most on concessional terms) that directly address the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis by seeking to help both refugees and their host communities. </p>
<p>These projects support jobs, economic opportunities, health, education, and emergency services to shore up social resilience and local infrastructure. The World Bank also manages the Lebanon Syria Crisis Trust Fund, established in 2014 to provide grant financing to projects mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in Lebanon. The Fund is financed by the Bank's State- and Peace-Building Trust Fund, as well as the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark. It has supported emergency projects improving education, health, and municipal services, and social safety nets. </p>

        <p>Emerging from decades of conflict, Timor-Leste became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century in May 2002.</p>
<p>Faced with the task of rebuilding public infrastructure – including roads, ports and airports, water and sanitation systems, and government facilities – and institutional frameworks, Timor-Leste has made significant progress in key areas since independence. Meanwhile, fragility remains a challenge as the country contends with legacies of past conflict.</p>
<p>Today, with a population of 1.3 million people, Timor-Leste is a peaceful, democratic nation. While poverty levels remain high, progress has been made in improving living standards. The proportion of Timorese living in poverty declined from 50% in 2007 to an estimated 42% in 2014.</p>
<p>Investments in human capital are directly linked to Timor-Leste's future growth, productivity, and competitiveness. In 2017, the Human Capital Index for Timor-Leste stood at 0.43, as compared to the East Asia and the Pacific's regional average of 0.61. A healthier and more skilled workforce is necessary to better meet the future labor demands across the economy and increase earnings.  </p>
<p>While Timor-Leste has succeeded in saving the proceeds of its natural resource endowment, key remaining challenges include how to increase the productivity and effectiveness of government spending, and how to ensure the environment is preserved as an important economic and social resource for future generations.</p>
<p>Encouraging private sector-led growth in the economy will be vital for job creation. In a young country with a fast-changing political and social landscape, there is also a need to focus on improving institutions that create the enabling environment for good policy-making, economic prosperity and inclusivity.</p>

        <p><b>Political context</b></p>
<p>A new government led by Hichem Mechichi was sworn in on September 2<sup>nd</sup>. In his speech before Parliament the day of the confidence vote, Prime Minister Mechichi said his priority is to help address the economic and social situation—stop the bleeding of public finances, start talks with lenders, and begin reform programs, including for public companies and subsidies.</p>
<p>Yet since its inauguration, the government has yet to present a clear strategy to address Tunisia's deep economic and financial challenges, even when the country has reached unprecedented budget deficit levels and deteriorating public services. While the COVID-19 crisis has aggravated the situation, economic resilience had been drained by several years of indecisive public policies and a growing protectionist stance.</p>
<p><b>Macroeconomic context</b></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is having a heavier impact than previously anticipated. The lock-down simultaneously suppressed domestic supply and demand, contracting GDP by 21% (year-over-year) in the second quarter. At the same time, reduced external demand and travel restrictions lowered tourism receipts by 47% and reduced exports of mechanic and electric industry and textiles (Tunisia's main manufacturing exports) by 27% by (year-over-year) as of mid-2020.</p>
<p>Other factors are affecting growth this year. The country suffered from further political upheaval as Elyes Fakhfakh's recently-formed government fell, which added more uncertainty, and worker disruptions are affecting mining output. Taken together, these factors are contributing to an expected 9% contraction in 2020, down from the first Covid forecast of -4%. In this context, unemployment increased from 15% to 18% in the second quarter of the year, a level last reached in the time of the 2011 revolution.</p>
<p>Poverty and vulnerability are expected to grow and invert a trend observed in the last years of fast poverty reduction. According to a series of telephone interviews conducted by INS and the World Bank, there is evidence that pandemic has modified eating habits. Poorer households have reduced quantities consumed or started consuming less preferred foods. To cope with rising food prices or to make up for jobs losses, households drew on their savings, received help or borrowed money from relatives and deferred payment of their obligations. In 2020, extreme poverty—measured using the international poverty line of living on US$1.90 per-day—will still be below 1%; however, poverty measured with the US$3.20 per-day line will increase by about 1.3 percentage points, from 2.9% to 4.2%.  Additionally, the percentage of the population that is “vulnerable” to fall into poverty is expected to increase in 2020. Using an expenditure threshold of US$ 5.50 per-day, the number of poor and of those vulnerable to poverty is expected to increase from 16.6% to 22% of the total population.</p>
<p>The current account deficit remains high at an expected 7.1% of GDP in 2020, but it has improved (from 8.8% in 2019) as imports decline at a faster pace than exports. These factors are supporting continued growth in forex reserves, which stood at 142 days of import by August (against 95 days a year earlier).</p>
<p>In contrast, the fiscal deficit project to reach 12%, aggravated by an 11% decline in revenues by mid-year, reflecting the reduction in economic activity and tax deferral measures. The wage bill increased by 14% by mid-2020, adding to spending pressures and signaling lack of progress in containing civil service pay. These developments are worsening debt vulnerabilities. Public debt is forecasted to rise from 72.2% of GDP in 2019 to a peak of 86.6% of GDP in 2020, well above the emerging market debt burden benchmark of 70% of GDP.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>Uganda's economy has experienced a slowdown in growth due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic crisis, a locust invasion and flooding caused by heavy rains. Uganda's real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 is projected to be between 0.4 and 1.7% compared to 5.6% in 2019. Exports, tourism, remittances, foreign direct investment and portfolio flows shrunk during the second half of FY20 due to international trade disruptions and restrictions of movement of people. This has created significant fiscal and external imbalance, and a deceleration in growth in services, primarily in real estate activities and information and communications technology.  </p>
<p>The medium-term outlook is also not favorable for Uganda. The decline in Uganda's real GDP growth and corresponding loss of jobs could be even larger if the country were to face a more widespread pandemic and further locust invasions, as this could deter a rapid economic recovery. Heightened uncertainty around the upcoming February 2021 elections further exacerbate these risks. </p>
<p>While about 700,000 young people reach working age every year in Uganda, only 75,000 jobs are created each year. This leaves more than 70% of Ugandans employed in agriculture, mainly on a subsistence basis. An average of one million young people are expected to reach working age between 2030-2040.   </p>
<p>Finally, regional instability, pandemic preparedness (Ebola and coronavirus) and broader global trade uncertainty could undermine exports and affect growth and have implications for debt sustainability and the current account. </p>
<p><b>Development Challenges </b></p>
<p>Uganda has achieved remarkable results in reducing poverty over the past decades, mainly driven by the agriculture sector. From 1992 to 2013, the percentage of Ugandan households living in poverty was halved, but vulnerability to external shocks remains high; for every three Ugandans who get out of poverty, two fall back in. </p>
<p>All Uganda's regions registered an increase in the number of poor people with the notable exception of the Northern region, which is the poorest, and where poverty decreased from 44% to 33%. COVID19 has worsened the effects of poverty and up to three million people could fall into poverty particularly in urban areas, above the estimated 8.7 million in FY17. Current social protection programs are inadequate, reaching just 3% of the population and increasing overall vulnerability to shocks. </p>
<p><b>Human Capital in Uganda </b></p>
<p>Uganda's Human Capital Index (HCI) is low; a child born in Uganda today is expected to be 38% as productive when she grows up, as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. A child in Uganda completes seven years of education by age 18, compared to 8.1 for their regional counterparts. However, actual years of learning are 4.5, with the 2.5 years considered ‘wasted' due to poor quality of education. For instance, only 6% of children in Uganda can read a paragraph at the end of the fourth grade. </p>
<p>Undernutrition is high and stunting affects one-third of all children in Uganda aged five years and below. At 3%, Uganda's annual population growth rate is among the highest in the world, despite a reduction in fertility rates. Uganda's population of 35 million is expected to reach 100 million by 2050, while the annual urban growth rate of 5.2% is among the highest in the world and is expected to grow from 6.4 million (2014) to 22 million by 2040. </p>
<p>Uganda's refugee population has almost tripled since July 2016 and is currently around 1.4 million, making it the largest refugee host in Africa, and third largest in the world. While its open-door refugee policy is one of the most progressive in the world with refugees enjoying access to social services, land and can move and work freely, the continued influx is straining host communities and service delivery.</p>

        <p>A vast country with a long coastline and central plateau, Angola thrusts inland across Southern Africa to border Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its principal cities, including its capital, Luanda, look west over the South Atlantic to Brazil, another Portuguese-speaking nation (like itself). It has a population of more than 30 million (2018). </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview </b></p>
<p>Despite significant progress on macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, Angola is still suffering the effects of lower oil prices and production levels, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) contraction around 1.2% in 2018. The oil sector accounts for one-third of GDP and more than 90% of exports. The transformation of a state-led oil economy to a private-sector-led growth model is a complex and long-term process and the oil sector will continue to play an important role during this transition period. </p>
<p>Macroeconomic stability has been restored and maintained through a more flexible exchange rate regime, restrictive monetary policy, and fiscal consolidation. The government has delivered on several key reforms since taking office in 2017, including the new law on Preventing and Combating Money Laundering, as well as the privatization law, the setup of a one-stop window for investors to improve the business climate, and the establishment of a social protection registry to protect the most vulnerable from the reforms. These reforms are already producing some positive results, as Angola tapped the Eurobond market again in the amount of $3.0 billion, and the IMF has approved the second review of the EFF program in December 2019. </p>
<p>The Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) has maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance to anchor inflation and to offset the impact of the exchange rate devaluation. The BNA continued its efforts to reach a more flexible exchange rate by allowing the oil companies to sell foreign exchange directly to commercial banks, contributing to strengthen buffers against external shocks. Inflation remained high but continued to decline from 18.6% in 2018 to 16.9% in 2019, reflecting weak economic activity and muted exchange rate pass-through. </p>
<p>The authorities are actively addressing financial sector vulnerabilities. The BNA increased minimum capital requirements for banks. An Asset Quality Review (AQR) was conducted with the support of IMF and has indicated that the financial sector is sound.  </p>
<p>Angola is expected to remain in recession in 2020 due to the recent plunge in oil prices and the global slowdown resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Oil sector growth will be highly affected due to the combined effect of supply and demand shocks. Non-oil sector growth is also projected to decline due to spillover effects from lower oil prices, reduced imported capital goods, tighter financing conditions, currency depreciation, and restrictions in the movements of goods and people </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic disruptions caused by it put at risk Angola's achievements of macro-economic stabilization and transition to a more sustainable and inclusive growth model.  </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>Angola has maintained political stability since the end of the 27-year civil war in 2002. In 2010, a constitution established a presidential parliamentary system with the president no longer elected by direct popular vote but instead as the head of the party winning the most seats.  </p>
<p>While no official statement has been made thus far, the planned local elections scheduled for 2020 are likely to be postponed due to the crises posed by covid-19 and low oil prices.   </p>
<p>Internationally, Angola is becoming more assertive and demonstrating a more steadfast commitment to peace and stability in Africa, particularly in the Great Lakes region. Very recently it facilitated an agreement to end mounting tensions between the neighbors Rwanda and Uganda.   </p>
<p><b>Development Challenges </b></p>
<p>Angola has made substantial economic and political progress since the end of the war in 2002. However, the country continues to face massive development challenges, which include reducing its dependency on oil and diversifying the economy; rebuilding its infrastructure; and improving institutional capacity, governance, public financial management systems, human development indicators, and the living conditions of the population. </p>
<p>Large pockets of the population live in poverty without adequate access to basic services, and the country could benefit from more inclusive development policies. According to 2018/2019  Expenditure and Income Survey from national institute of statistics, poverty index was at 40.6%. A social protection scheme program has been launched with a pilot cash transfer project which will benefit over 1.6 million vulnerable families until 2022 across the country.  </p>

        <h3>Country Context</h3>
<p>The political system in BiH is complex, reflecting the provisions of the country's constitution developed to end ethnic conflict, as well as subsequent changes to the system introduced under the guidance of the international community through the Office of the High Representative.</p>
<p>In July 2015, the Council of Ministers of BiH, Government of Republika Srpska (RS), and Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) adopted a joint program of structural reforms known as the reform agenda. This reform agenda presents a rare window of opportunity for structural reforms in BiH, underpinned by a broad national consensus on the country's critical challenges and priorities and the sustained support of key development partners.</p>
<p>BiH's key economic challenge is the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports.</p>
<p>The country needs to shift to a business environment conducive to private investment that supports both vibrant small and medium-sized enterprises and the growth of larger companies, facilitates export performance and productivity improvements, and generates much-needed private sector employment.</p>
<p>At the same time as addressing these imbalances in the economic model, the country must also ensure the sustainability and inclusiveness of future growth.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p><b>CONTEXT</b></p>
<p>Botswana is located at the center of Southern Africa, positioned between South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. One of the world's poorest countries at independence in 1966, it rapidly became one of the world's development success stories. Significant mineral (diamond) wealth, good governance, prudent economic management and a relatively small population of slightly more than two million, have made it an upper middle-income country with a transformation agenda of becoming a high-income country by 2036.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Botswana's stable political environment includes a multi-party democratic tradition, with general elections held every five years. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has been in power since 1966. In October 23, 2019 Botswana held its 11<sup>th</sup> general elections, with His Excellency President Dr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi assuming the presidency. The new cabinet was announced on Nov 6, 2019 and Honorable Dr. Thapelo Matsheka was appointed the Minister of Finance and Economic Development.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>Botswana has historically enjoyed strong and stable growth since independence, with sizable fiscal buffers and prudent policies playing a key role in shielding the economy. More recently, however, the limitations of Botswana's diamond-led development model have become more apparent: growth is slower, inequality remains high and job creation is limited. At the same time, increased diamond market volatility—including growing competition from synthetic diamonds, reduced Southern African Customs Union transfers and fiscal expansion have resulted in eroded fiscal buffers.</p>
<p>Botswana's economy faces an unprecedented challenge due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, only a year after weakening global demand for diamonds and severe droughts led to a slowdown in growth to 3 percent in 2019 (from 4.5% in 2018). The economy is expected to contract by at least 9.1% in 2020 as COVID-19's impact on global demand, travel restrictions and social distancing measures constrain output in key production and export sectors, including the diamond industry and tourism. Both external and fiscal pressures will become accentuated in 2020, with the overall deficit set to double (from 4% of GDP last year). Nevertheless, debt levels are set to likely remain below prudence levels.</p>
<p>Developments in the global diamond industry will have a telling impact on the short-term recovery given Botswana's dependence on the commodity. Whilst a mild recovery is expected for 2021, the economic impact of COVID-19 is likely to be deep and long-lasting. The authorities' ability to advance on key reforms laid out in its 2020-2023 Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan will thus play a key role in creating conditions for broad-based growth and thus improving Botswana's economic performance.</p>
<p><b>Social Context</b></p>
<p>Living conditions have improved for the Botswana people, and poverty has fallen significantly. The share of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at the 2011 Purchasing Power Parity declined steadily from 29.8% to 18.2% between 2002–03 and 2009–10, and to 16.1% in 2015-16. This rapid poverty reduction can be attributed mainly to a combination of increasing agricultural incomes, including subsidies, and demographic changes.</p>
<p>Progress in reducing poverty has been accompanied by improvements in shared prosperity. The growth rate of consumption per capita between 2009–10 and 2015-16 for the bottom 40 percentile of the population was 0.42% annually, higher than the growth rate of the top 60 percentile. However, Botswana's performance was only in the middle of the worldwide shared-prosperity distribution.</p>
<p>Inequality has fallen as well, albeit still being high. Between 2010 and 2015, inequality, measured by the Gini index, fell from 60.5% to 53.3%. Among factors associated with Botswana's declining income inequality, the key one is regional convergence due to fast growth in rural areas and demographic changes. However, Botswana remains one of the world's most unequal countries.</p>
<p>The recent Botswana Multi-Topic Survey: Labour Force Module Report indicates that the unemployment rate has gone up by 3.1 percentage points from 17.6% to 20.7% with youth unemployment posing a critical challenge. Addressing these challenges will require improving the quality of infrastructure (water and electricity), essential basic services (education, health, and social safety nets), as well as accelerating reforms to the business environment and effective support for entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">World Bank's Human Capital Index (HCI)</a> scores <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/hci/HCI_2pager_BWA.pdf"">Botswana at 0.42</a>. The purpose of the HCI is to promote attention and action to improving the level and quality of government investments in child health, nutrition, and education given their strong links to labor productivity and economic competitiveness. Botswana's HCI score suggests that a Motswana child born today will only be 42% as productive when she grows up as she could have been if she had enjoyed complete education and health. Education expenditure is among the highest in the world and includes the provision of nearly universal free primary education but has not created a skilled workforce.</p>

<p>Bulgaria has undergone a significant transformation over the past three decades. It has changed from a highly centralized, planned economy to an open, market-based, upper-middle-income country securely anchored in the European Union (EU). In its initial transition, Bulgaria went through a decade of slow economic restructuring and growth, high indebtedness, and a loss of savings.</p>
<p>However, the advancement of structural reforms starting in the late 1990s, the introduction of the currency board, and expectations of EU accession unleashed a decade of exceptionally high economic growth and improved living standards. Yet, a number of legacies from that early period, the global economic crisis of 2008, and a period of political instability in 2013–14 undid some of those gains.</p>
<p>In the current period, the ongoing pandemic is currently forecast to drag the economy into a recession in 2020. Poverty is projected to increase, given the job losses and rising vulnerabilities associated with the crisis and the possible negative impact of rising minimum wages on employment among the unskilled. The poor are more vulnerable to health shocks because they often have less access to health care and lower savings to protect them from a financial catastrophe. </p>
<p>Additionally, they are more likely to suffer from income losses as a result of quarantines and/or disruptions in economic activity. Bulgaria will need to adopt bold recovery measures to increase productivity by at least 4 percent per year in order to catch up with average EU income levels and boost shared prosperity.</p>

        <p>Djibouti is one of the smallest countries in Africa, with an area of 23,200 square kilometers and a population estimated at about 990,000. The size of its economy limits its ability to diversify production and increases its reliance on foreign markets, making it more vulnerable to market downturns and hampering its access to external capital. With less than 1,000 square kilometers of arable land (0.04% of its total land area) and average annual rainfall of only 130 millimeters, Djibouti depends almost completely on imports to meet its food needs. </p>
<p>Djibouti's strength lies in its strategic location at the southern entrance to the Red Sea, marking a bridge between Africa and the Middle East. Adjacent to some of the world's busiest shipping lanes (between Asia and Europe), it hosts military bases for France, the United States, Japan, China, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as for other countries with forces supporting global anti-piracy efforts. </p>
<p>Djibouti's US$2 billion city-state economy is driven by a state-of-the-art port complex, among the most sophisticated in the world. Trade through the port is expected to grow rapidly in parallel with the expanding economy of the country's largest neighbor and main trading partner, Ethiopia. Djibouti has some natural assets that could be used for tourism, as well as untapped marine resources that could support more artisanal fishing, and an infrastructure of undersea telecommunications cables from which it could develop new digital and service industries. Renewable energy could be another source of growth, as Djibouti has geothermal, solar, and eolian potential. </p>
<p>Djibouti's economic activity contracted in 2020 for the first time in two decades as a result of COVID-19. Lockdown measures and the suspension of international travel severely hit construction, general trade, air and urban transportation, and services. A resurgence of the pandemic, political instability, and the vulnerability of the Horn of Africa to natural disasters, such as desert locusts, would undermine the productivity of sizable infrastructure investment. </p>
<p>The medium-term economic outlook remains positive despite the impact of COVID-19: Growth is expected to average 7.1% per year in 2021–2022, driven by a rebound in Ethiopia, which will underpin free zone reexports and exports of transportation, logistics, and telecommunication services. Ongoing infrastructure projects are also expected to boost growth. </p>

        <p>Thanks to the boom in oil prices between 2004 and 2014, Ecuador experienced a period of growth and poverty reduction. Nevertheless, the 2014 decline in oil prices revealed the country's lack of macroeconomic cushions and limited private investment.</p>
<p>In the absence of fiscal savings, Ecuador has attempted to adapt its economy to a challenging global context with support from international organizations, including the World Bank Group. In this context, the country is promoting a reform program to ensure fiscal sustainability, strengthen the foundations of dollarization, encourage private investment and guarantee social protection for the most vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>The discussion and implementation of these reforms have faced some challenges, however, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices. These last two shocks will trigger a significant economic downturn and an increase in poverty, despite government efforts to reprioritize public spending and mobilize external financing to respond to the health emergency and protect the most vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>In this context, it is crucial to maintain coordinated efforts to save lives, contain the economic and social costs of the Covid-19 crisis and establish the foundations for a rapid, effective recovery.</p>
<p>Fiscal consolidation and private sector development are pivotal for achieving macroeconomic stability. It is necessary to maintain and create new job opportunities to reduce poverty and make families more resilient to external and natural disaster shocks. Additionally, safeguarding social protection mechanisms is indispensable for the most vulnerable sectors.</p>

        <p>Equatorial Guinea, also referred to as EQG, is the only former Spanish colony in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is composed of a mainland, Rio Muni, and small islands including Bioko where the capital Malabo is located, Annobon, Corisco, Elobey, and others. According to a 2015 population census, the population is 1.2 million people. The country is bordered in the north by Cameroon, in the east and south by Gabon, and to the west by the Gulf of Guinea. It is well endowed with arable land and mineral resources ranging from gold, oil, uranium, diamond, and columbite-tantalite, and notably petroleum discovered in the 1990s.</p>
<p><b>Political Overview</b></p>
<p>President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has served for 39 years, making him the longest-serving head of state in Sub-Saharan Africa. His position was bolstered by his landslide victory in the last presidential election in November 2009. The absence of real checks and balances grants his political party, the Partido democratico de Guinea Ecuatorial (PDGE), absolute executive power. The country's constitution was amended following the November 2011 referendum and a new government was appointed in May 2012. The legislative, senatorial and municipal elections were held in May 2013 and confirmed the domination of the ruling party, PDGE. However, legalized opposition parties continue to voice their discontent over the country's governance but their capacity to influence policy is limited.</p>
<p>After a government reshuffle in 2017, M. Nchama, former governor of the Bank of Central African States, was appointed the new minister of Economy and Planning. While still fragile, the socio-political situation remains stable.  </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>The country has been one of the fastest growing economies in Africa in the past decade. After the discovery of large oil reserves in the 1990s, Equatorial Guinea became the third-largest producer of oil in Sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria and Angola. More recently, substantial gas reserves have also been discovered. However, the country macroeconomic and fiscal situation has deteriorated following the oil price drop.</p>
<p>EQG experienced the full extent of the Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) crisis because of its large dependence on oil exports and lack of sufficient buffers, such as government deposits and international reserves and while it has announced plans for adjustment is has not yet reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The government's development agenda is guided by a medium-term strategy paper, the National Economic Development Plan: Horizon 2020, which targets economic diversification and poverty reduction. The first phase of Horizon 2020 focused on infrastructure development was concluded in 2012. The second phase will focus on economic diversification, targeting strategic new sectors such as fisheries, agriculture, tourism and finance.</p>
<p>As the country moves into the second phase of the National Development Plan, the government is planning to redirect public investment from infrastructure towards the development of new economic sectors. Equatorial Guinea is largely dependent on oil. The significant economic impact of the recent drop in international oil prices has underscored the importance of promoting non-oil growth and increasing efficiency of spending.</p>
<p>Equatorial Guinea is among the countries worst hit by the Central African Economic Monetary Community (CEMAC) crisis which started in 2014, facing twin deficits and a rapid loss of international reserves stemming from dependence on oil exports, lack of sufficient buffers, and weak public financial management (PFM) procedures.</p>
<p>To restore its external and fiscal imbalances, Equatorial Guinea is undertaking several reforms and has entered into an IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in May 2018. The reforms include raising non-hydrocarbon tax revenues and reducing the non-hydrocarbon primary deficit, improving PFM in coordination with the other CEMAC countries, supporting social sectors, protecting the banking sector through the non-accumulation of new arrears, and improving governance.</p>
<p>EQG became member of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in May 2017. For the government, joining OPEC could be an attempt to bolster foreign investment and technology transfers from other member countries, especially from the Gulf.  </p>

<p>Kazakhstan has a land area equal to that of Western Europe but one of the lowest population densities globally. Strategically, it links the large and fast-growing markets of China and South Asia and those of Russia and Western Europe by road, rail, and a port on the Caspian Sea. </p>
<p>The country has transitioned from lower-middle-income to upper-middle-income status in less than two decades, moving to the latter group in 2006. Since 2002, GDP per capita has risen sixfold and poverty incidence has fallen sharply, significantly improving the country's performance on the World Bank's indicator of shared prosperity. </p>
<p>The global economic slowdown and internal structural weakness have challenged the sustainability of Kazakhstan's growth model. Sluggish productivity growth, excessive state involvement in the economy, and increased dependence on commodities have been the main contributors to the weak economic performance. This year Kazakhstan is facing a sharp decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment and poverty, despite the substantial fiscal response. The COVID-19 pandemic has further reinforced the urgent need for reforms to reverse the declining growth capacity. </p>
<p>To support a resilient and sustainable economic recovery, Kazakhstan needs to promote important reforms: </p>
<ul>
<li>First, diversifying the economic base by improving the competitiveness of its non-extractive sectors and continuing reforms in the financial sector </li>
<li>Second, limiting the dominance of large state-owned enterprises in the economy, strengthening competition, and reducing the government role in deciding the allocation of resources, which distorts the environment for the private sector</li>
<li>Third, strengthening public sector institutions and reinforcing the rule of law to attract much-needed investment.</li>

        <p><i>Last updated: April 2020</i></p>
<p>Since gaining independence in 1957, Malaysia has successfully diversified its economy from one that was initially agriculture and commodity-based, to one that now plays host to robust manufacturing and service sectors, which have propelled the country to become a leading exporter of electrical appliances, electronic parts and components.</p>
<p>Malaysia is one of the most open economies in the world with a trade to GDP ratio averaging over 130% since 2010. Openness to trade and investment has been instrumental in employment creation and income growth, with about 40% of jobs in Malaysia linked to export activities. After the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, Malaysia's economy has been on an upward trajectory, averaging growth of 5.4% since 2010, and is expected to achieve its transition from an upper middle-income economy to a high-income economy by 2024.</p>
<p>However, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has had a major economic impact on Malaysia, particularly on its vulnerable households. With less than 1% of Malaysian households living in extreme poverty (according to the official national poverty line), the government's focus has shifted toward addressing the well-being of the poorest 40% of the population (“the bottom 40”). This low-income group remains particularly vulnerable to economic shocks as well as increases in the cost of living and mounting financial obligations.</p>
<p>Income inequality in Malaysia remains high relative to other East Asian countries but is gradually declining. While income growth for the bottom 40 has outpaced the top 60 over much of the last decade, the absolute gap across income groups has increased, contributing to widespread perceptions of the poor being “left behind.” Following the removal of broad-based subsidies, the government has gradually moved toward more targeted measures to support the poor and vulnerable, mainly in the form of cash transfers to low-income households.</p>
<p>Malaysia's near-term economic outlook will be more dependent than usual on government measures to sustain private sector activity as the shock of COVID-19 reduces export-led growth, and as a depleted fiscal space limits public investment-led expansion. Over the longer term, as Malaysia converges with high-income economies, incremental growth will depend less on factor accumulation and more on raising productivity to sustain higher potential growth. While significant, Malaysia's productivity growth over the past 25 years has been below that of several global and regional comparators. Ongoing reform efforts to tackle key structural constraints will be vital to support and sustain Malaysia's development path.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank's Human Capital Index, Malaysia ranks 55th out of 157 countries. To fully realize its human potential and fulfil the country's aspiration of achieving the high-income and developed country status, Malaysia will need to advance further in education, health and nutrition, and social protection outcomes. Key priority areas include enhancing the quality of schooling to improve learning outcomes, rethinking nutritional interventions to reduce childhood stunting, and providing adequate social welfare protection for household investments in human capital formation.</p>

        <p>In 2017 Nicaragua maintained a good growth rate of 4.6 percent. Due to the social and political unrest that the country has experienced since April 2018, the economy contracted to -4.0 and -3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, respectively. According to the latest forecasts, for 2020 growth is expected to fall to -5.9 percent, and would recover slowly to 1.1 percent by 2021.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic plus the violence that has prevailed in the last years, job losses, a fall in consumer and business confidence, and a decline in labor intensive sectors such as construction, commerce and tourism have taken a social and economic toll, further halting progress achieved in poverty reduction since 2005.</p>
<p>Poverty – defined as living with an income below $3.2 per person per day in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) – will increase to 15.1 percent in 2020 (from 9.7 percent in 2017), adding more than 350,000 people into poverty. Meanwhile, remittances increased by 9.9 percent year over year in the first half of 2019, supporting household consumption and mitigating deeper poverty increases. The pandemic, however, has the potential to lower this level of remittances in the short term.</p>
<p>Currently, the pandemic is expected to adversely affect Nicaragua through declined remittance inflows, reduced trade, paralyzed tourism, and increased risk premiums, partially offset by lower oil prices.</p>
<p>Nicaragua is still one of Latin America's least developed countries, where access to basic services is a daily challenge.</p>
<p>The World Bank has supported poverty reduction measures in Nicaragua through the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ida.worldbank.org/"">International Development Association (IDA)</a>, the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries.</p>

<p>Before the coronavirus outbreak hit the global economy, Poland was among the fastest-growing economies in the European Union (EU). Household consumption, fueled by increases in budgetary expenditures, a tight labor market, and rising wages, continued to grow.</p>
<p>This, together with continuing low interest rates and the execution of European funds–related investments, helped Poland's economic growth prospects.</p>
<p>In the short-term, however, the main challenge is to mitigate the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the full impact of the virus remains uncertain, a prolonged outbreak would significantly curb economic activity, strain the health care system, affect supply chains, and depress investor sentiment and consumer demand, ultimately impacting the supply side and leading to a deeper recession.</p>
<p>Under such a downside scenario, the economic and fiscal impact in 2020 would be more severe, with implications for jobs and poverty. On the positive side, Poland has the fiscal and monetary space to mitigate the adverse effects of lower global and domestic demand and shield its financially vulnerable populations, potentially leading to a quicker rebound in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>The main medium-term challenge to sustained growth is a tightening labor supply exacerbated by an aging population.</p>

        <h3>Country Context</h3>
<p>Supported by stable oil production and a modest acceleration in domestic demand, real GDP expanded by 1.4 percent in 2018. While oil production plateaued, the hydrocarbons sector overall posted growth of 1.1 percent, thanks to higher exports of natural gas. The non-energy economy expanded by 1.8 percent, reflecting greater dynamism in most economic sectors. Consumer price inflation decelerated sharply in 2018, falling to 1.6 percent from 7.9 percent in 2017.</p>
<p>Since the presidential election in April 2018, the Government of Azerbaijan has undergone significant changes. These include the nomination of a new prime minister and the appointment of several key ministers in charge of education, tax reforms, agriculture and rural development, the environment, and energy. The new Government has been tasked with continuing the reforms in key sectors to recover economic growth.</p>
<p>Since economic prospects will largely rely on rising gas exports, the projected acceleration in growth in the medium term will be temporary. The country needs reforms to boost private sector investment, reduce the state footprint, tackle issues of competitiveness, and develop human capital.</p>
<p>The notable increases in the 2019 budget allocations for education (up by 13 percent) and health care (by 44.5 percent) are important in terms of improving human capital. But further efforts are needed to align budget spending with development needs, including through strengthening medium-term budgeting and the public investment management system.</p>

        <p><a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/prosper-bangladesh"">Bangladesh</a> has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, supported by sustained economic growth. Based on the international poverty line of $1.90 (using 2011 Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate) a day, it reduced poverty from 43.8 percent in 1991 to 14.8 percent by 2016.</p>
<p>Life expectancy, literacy rates and per capita food production have increased significantly. Progress has been underpinned by steady growth in GDP. Bangladesh reached the lower middle-income country status in 2015. In 2018, Bangladesh fulfilled all three eligibility criteria for graduation from the UN's Least Developed Countries (LDC) list for the first time and is on track for graduation in 2024.</p>
<p>Sustained economic growth has created an increased demand for energy, transport and urbanization. Insufficient planning and investment have resulted in severe infrastructure bottlenecks, congestion and pollution. To become an upper-middle income economy, continued sound macroeconomic management, financial sector stability, structural reforms, investment in human capital, higher female labor force participation, and global integration will be important. Improving infrastructure as well as the business climate would allow new productive sectors to develop and generate quality employment.</p>

<p>Bangladesh is both an inspiration and a challenge for policymakers and practitioners of development. While the country recorded strong performance in income growth and human development, Bangladesh faces daunting challenges with an increased level of vulnerability with about 39 million people still living below the national poverty line.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic will deepen the challenges including a decline in exports, lower private investment, and job losses. Investment and exports are likely to continue to suffer amid uncertainty about the recovery of global demand. The poor and vulnerable are more impacted with income loss and poverty may rise. The implementation of the government's COVID-19 response program will remain a paramount priority.</p>
<p>Creating more and better jobs for its youth remains a critical priority for Bangladesh to turn around and achieve its development vision. To do so, Bangladesh will need to remove the barriers to higher investment posed by low access to reliable and affordable power, poor transportation infrastructure, limited availability of serviced land, uncertain and complex business regulation, among others. Challenges related to COVID-19, rapid urbanization and climate change need to be addressed through long-term planning.</p>
<p>With the right policies and timely action, Bangladesh can accelerate its recovery from the economic downturn and continue to progress towards upper-middle income status.</p>

        <p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p>
<p>A small, landlocked country nestled deep in the Himalayas between India and China, Bhutan is characterized by steep mountains and deep valleys, which led to scattered population settlement patterns. The country is famous for its unique philosophy – Gross National Happiness (GNH) – which guides its development. Abundant water resources create ideal conditions for hydropower development which has spurred economic growth. Fiscal revenues from hydropower have helped finance large investments in human capital which led to significant improvements in service delivery and educational and health outcomes. Access to electricity is almost universal while access to functional piped water was 95 percent in 2015.</p>
<p>Bhutan maintains solid growth and macroeconomic stability. Hydropower construction and supportive fiscal and monetary policy have contributed to solid growth. Single-digit inflation, a stable exchange rate, and accumulating international reserves attest to the stability. Nevertheless, structural challenges remain, including large current account deficits, high public debt, an underdeveloped private sector, and a high youth unemployment rate. A delay in hydropower construction could cloud macroeconomic prospects in the coming years.</p>
<p>Bhutan has a stable political and economic environment.  It has made a tremendous progress in reducing extreme poverty and promoting gender equality, while attention is needed to address inequality issues.</p>
<p>World Bank Group (WBG) support is guided by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2015-2019 and the 2017 Performance and Learning Review (PLR).  It focuses on improving fiscal and spending efficiency, increasing private-sector growth and competitiveness and supporting green development.  The WBG has also almost completed the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) as a basis for the formulation of its next County Partnership Framework (CPF) in alignment with the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) of the Royal Government of Bhutan. </p>
<p><b>COUNTRY CONTEXT</b></p>
<p>Bhutan's political environment has been stable and economic conditions have improved in recent years. Since Bhutan shifted to a democratic constitutional monarchy in 2008, the country has developed a solid development management system founded on the principle of GNH. The country successfully completed its third parliamentary elections in 2018 and the new government has endorsed the 12th FYP for 2018-2023. Bhutan maintains strong economic and strategic relationships with India, particularly as the major trading partner, as a source of foreign aid and as a financier and buyer of hydropower. Bhutan is vulnerable to natural disasters and climate-related risks.</p>
<p>Bhutan has become a lower-middle income country and poverty has been cut by two-thirds in the last decade. Average annual growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been 7.5 percent since the early 1980s, making Bhutan one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, at $3,080 in 2018, is now three times the threshold for lower middle-income countries and only 10 percent below the threshold for upper-middle income countries. Poverty measured using the $3.20 poverty line (in 2011 PPP terms) has declined from 36 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2017. There was good progress in shared prosperity, though the pace of progress slowed down in recent years.</p>
<p><b>RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS</b></p>
<p>Bhutan's economy continues to be dominated by hydropower and its economic relationship with India. Growth is estimated to have rebounded to 5 percent in FY2019 after a deceleration to 4.6 percent in FY2018 due to maintenance and on-boarding delays on two major power plants (Tala and Mangdechhu). On the demand side, growth was underpinned by exports and consumption, reflecting the progress in hydropower maintenance and a procyclical public demand response to the associated income inflows. Services remain the main driver of growth on the supply side, where wholesale and retail trade has emerged as the key contributing sub-sector.</p>
<p>Approximately 80 percent of Bhutan's imports are from India, and the Bhutanese Ngultrum is pegged to the Indian Rupee. Thus, inflation between the countries is closely linked. FY2019 began with a slowdown in inflation, hitting a low of just above 2 percent in July 2018 before gradually increasing to 3.1 percent in April 2019 due to food and oil price dynamics. The exchange rate has followed the appreciation of the Indian Rupee in recent months, decreasing from 70.78 BTN per USD to about 69 BTN per USD in August 2019.</p>
<p>Developments in the hydropower sector also contributed to a narrowing of the current account deficit to 16.3 percent of GDP in FY2019, as exports from the Tala plant expanded after the conclusion of maintenance work. At the same time, tourist arrivals increased by 8 percent in FY2019, contributing to the growth of service exports. The current account deficit was primarily financed through capital inflows from India. Foreign exchange reserves cover nearly 10.1 months of imports.</p>
<p>Bhutan has maintained its course of sustainable public finances, with the fiscal deficit estimated to have reduced to 2.1 percent of GDP in FY2019, from 4.6 percent two years prior. This reflects revenue growth from reforms that increased the corporate income tax base and changed the valuation rules for sales tax on vehicles in FY2018, and a slowdown in the initiation of new capital projects which limited spending growth. Government debt is estimated at 109.3 percent of GDP and is considered sustainable due to a special financing arrangement with India, which covers construction risks of hydropower plants and guarantees a return on surplus power purchases.</p>
<p>Little progress was observed in the labor market as labor force participation fell from 65.7 percent in 2017 to 62.6 percent in 2018. Agriculture contributes only 10 percent to GDP but accounts for 54 percent of employment. Working in agriculture is highly correlated with being poor: about 66 percent of poor household heads work in agriculture. Increases in agricultural exports and productivity helped reduce poverty in recent years. Extreme poverty at USD 1.90 per day is almost eliminated, a laudable achievement. The USD 3.20 poverty rate (in 2011 PPP) is estimated to have declined from 12 percent in 2017 to 11.2 percent in 2018. Hydropower is capital intensive and contributes little to job creation. Overall unemployment is low, but high youth unemployment represents Bhutan's challenge to create more and better jobs.</p>
<p><b>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</b></p>
<p>Growth is expected to edge up to 7.4 percent in FY2020 on the back of increased hydropower exports from the newly on-boarded Mangdechhu plant. In the medium term, growth is expected to stabilize between 5 and 6 percent, supported by the initiation of new public investment projects under the 12th Five Year Plan and the construction of the Punatsangchhu I and II hydro plants.</p>
<p>Inflation is expected to increase moderately in the near term, following a strong growth outlook in India and firming food and fuel prices. Increased hydropower exports are expected to narrow the current account deficit further, to 10 and 7 percent of GDP in FY2020 and FY2021, respectively.</p>
<p>The fiscal outlook for Bhutan foresees a joint expansion of revenue and expenditure that will temporarily widen the fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP by FY2021. Revenue growth is expected due to increased hydro revenue from the Mangdechhu power plant and the introduction of a green tax on fuel and a goods and services tax (GST). Expenditure growth in the short-term is expected to outpace revenue growth due to increased investments in non-hydro projects as part of the 12th Five-Year-Plan and public sector wage increases.</p>
<p>Poverty reduction will continue at a modest pace in the near term. The USD 3.20 poverty rate is expected to decline to 9.9 percent in 2019 and 8.7 percent in 2020. Diversification into non-hydropower sectors remains the key challenge to accelerating job creation in non-farm sectors. Maximizing the growth potential of the tourism sector could significantly contribute to jobs and income growth, especially among the rural poor and low-skilled. As poverty is almost exclusively rural, efforts to develop agribusinesses and increase agricultural productivity will need to continue, by investing in the downstream value chain.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>A landlocked country in East Africa, Burundi is a low-income economy where 80% of the population is employed by the agriculture sector. It is a country of the Great Lakes, surrounded by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east, the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west and bordered by Lake Tanganyika to the southwest. With a population of 11.6 million, of which 50.7% (2018) are women, it is one of the most densely populated countries. </p>
<p>Burundi has made significant progress in terms of quality and access to education. Since the introduction of free primary education in 2005, the Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) in primary education reached 120.3% in the 2018/2019 school year without significant variation between provinces, gender or wealth.</p>
<p><b>Political context</b></p>
<p>Burundi is a constitutional republic whose second largest city, Gitega, became the country's political capital in 2019. Gitega is home to the presidency of the Republic and the Senate, while the main state institutions are still located in Bujumbura, the economic capital. </p>
<p>Triple voting was organized in May 2020 and included presidential, parliamentary, and communal council elections. General Evariste Ndayishimiye, former Secretary General of the ruling CNDD-FDD party and majority candidate, won the elections. He replaces the late President Pierre Nkurunziza, who had just spent 15 years in power. The new Constitution establishes the Presidency of the Republic of Burundi for a renewable term of seven years and creates the office of Vice President and Prime Minister. These three bodies constitute the high authorities of the country. There are 36 political parties in the country, and the CNDD-FDD also won the majority of seats in the elections for Parliamentarians and Communal Councilors. </p>
<p><b>Socio-economic context</b></p>
<p>Burundi has experienced a unique economic situation over the last five years, due in particular to the decline in foreign aid since 2015, which has caused both fiscal and balance of payments difficulties. </p>
<p>To compensate for this loss, the government has mobilized domestic resources to a large extent, but this has not been sufficient to meet the continuously rising social demand driven by a very high population growth rate.  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Economic growth increased from 1.6% in 2018 to 1.8% in 2019</p></li>
<li><p>Deflation due to falling food prices in 2018 (-2.8%) continued in 2019 to -0.8% while inflation had reached 16% in 2017. </p></li>
<li><p>The economy is slowly recovering from this crisis, but the weakness of economic growth in relation to population growth results in low per capita income estimated at about $260 in 2019. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus)</b></p>
<p>In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has put in place mechanisms to mitigate the spread of the virus, including closure of the Bujumbura International Airport, mass COVID-19 screening, training for health care personnel and the establishment of care centers for those who test positive. </p>
<p>COVID-19 will also have repercussions on Burundi's economy, which is facing a double shock of supply and demand. All productive sectors are expected to contract, including agriculture, an important pillar of the Burundian economy. </p>

        <p>Over the past two decades, Cambodia has undergone a significant transition, reaching lower middle-income status in 2015 and aspiring to attain upper middle-income status by 2030. Driven by garment exports and tourism, Cambodia's economy has sustained an average growth rate of 8% between 1998 and 2018, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. While easing slightly, growth remained strong, estimated to have reached 7.1% in 2019, after the better-than-expected growth rate of 7.5% in 2018.</p>
<p>The global shock triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Cambodia's economy in 2020 at a time when Cambodia also faces the partial suspension of preferential access to the EU market under the “Everything but Arms” initiative. The outbreak caused sharp deceleration in most of Cambodia's main engines of growth—tourism, manufacturing exports, and construction—which together account for more than 70% of the country's growth and almost 40% of paid employment. The economy in 2020 is projected to register negative growth of -2%, the sharpest decline in Cambodia's recent history. The COVID-19 outbreak and slow recovery in global economic activity, alongside prolonged financial market turmoil, poses risks to Cambodia's growth outlook. </p>
<p>According to official estimates, the poverty rate in 2014 was 13.5% compared to 47.8% in 2007. About 90% of the poor live in the countryside. While Cambodia achieved in 2009 the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty, the vast majority of families who escaped poverty did so by a small margin. Around 4.5 million people remain near-poor, vulnerable to falling back into poverty when exposed to economic and other external shocks. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty in 2020 could increase among households involved in key sectors like tourism, construction, trade, manufacturing and the garment industry.  </p>
<p>Health and education, especially quality, remain important challenges and development priorities.</p>
<p>Cambodia has made considerable strides in improving maternal and child health, early childhood development, and primary education in rural areas. The maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births decreased from 472 in 2005 to 170 in 2014; the under-five mortality rate decreased from 83 per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 35 per 1,000 live births in 2014; and infant mortality rate decreased from 66 per 1,000 live births in 2005 to 28 per 1,000 live births in 2014.</p>
<p>Despite the progress in health and education outcomes, human capital indicators lag behind lower middle-income countries. A child born in Cambodia today will be only 49% as productive when grown as she could be if she enjoyed full quality education, good health, and proper nutrition during childhood. An estimated 1 in 3 children under the age of five suffer from stunting and only 36% of children between three and five years old are enrolled in early education.</p>
<p>While net enrollment in primary education increased from 82% in 1997 to 97% in 2016, lower secondary completion rates, at 57% in 2017, are significantly below the average for lower middle-income countries. As of 2017, 21% of Cambodia's population (3.4 million people) did not have access to improved water, and 34% (5.4 million people) did not have access to improved sanitation.</p>
<p>Key reforms are needed for Cambodia to sustain pro-poor growth, foster competitiveness, sustainably manage natural resource wealth and improve access to and quality of public services. Cambodia continues to have a serious infrastructure gap and would benefit from greater connectivity and investments in rural and urban infrastructure. Further diversification of the economy will require fostering entrepreneurship, expanding the use of technology and building new skills to address emerging labor market needs. Accountable and responsive public institutions will also be critical to meeting the evolving needs of citizens and the private sector.  And quality of human capital will be of utmost importance to achieve Cambodia's ambitious goal of reaching middle-income status by 2030.</p>

        <p>Since China began to open up and reform its economy in 1978, GDP growth has averaged almost 10 percent a year, and more than 850 million people have been lifted out of poverty.</p>
<p>Today, China is an upper-middle-income country and the world's second largest economy. But its per capita income is still only about a quarter of that of high-income countries, and about 373 million Chinese are living below the upper-middle-income poverty line of US$5.50 a day. China also lags in labor productivity and human capital.  Income inequality has improved over the last decade but remains relatively high.</p>
<p>China's high growth based on resource-intensive manufacturing, exports, and low-paid labor has largely reached its limits and has led to economic, social, and environmental imbalances. Reducing these imbalances requires shifts in the structure of the economy from low-end manufacturing to higher-end manufacturing and services, and from investment to consumption.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, growth has moderated in the face of structural constraints, including declining labor force growth, diminishing returns to investment, and slowing productivity. The challenge going forward is to find new drivers of growth while addressing the social and environmental legacies of China's previous development path.</p>
<p>China's rapid economic growth exceeded the pace of institutional development, and there are important institutional and reform gaps that China needs to address to ensure a high-quality and sustainable growth path. The role of the state needs to evolve and focus on providing stable market expectations and a clear and fair business environment, as well as strengthening the regulatory system and the rule of law to further support the market system.</p>
<p>Given its size, China is central to important regional and global development issues. China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and its air and water pollution affects other countries. Global environmental problems cannot be solved without China's engagement. Moreover, maintaining economic growth at reasonable levels has important spillovers for the growth of the rest of the world economy.</p>
<p>Many of the complex development challenges that China faces are relevant to other countries, including transitioning to a new growth model, rapid aging, building a cost-effective health system, and promoting a lower carbon energy path. China is a growing influence on other developing economies through trade, investment, and ideas.</p>
<p>China's most immediate challenge is related to the economic, social and public health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented economic shock in China and the global economy. China's economy has started to rebound from the COVID-19 induced shock, but the recovery remains uneven. While supply side constraints have largely eased, domestic demand and especially private consumption remain weak, reflecting lingering behavioral impacts of the pandemic, labor dislocation and slower growth in household incomes.</p>
<p>The situation calls for a macroeconomic policy mix aimed at rebuilding confidence and augmenting domestic demand in the short term while supporting the medium-term rebalancing to a greener and more inclusive economy. Specifically, policy makers should aim at closing the gaps in China's social protection coverage  to help protect workers and households from the distress caused by job and income losses and also boost private consumption. Beyond the immediate impacts, the current outbreak has uncovered vulnerabilities. This calls for resolute policy actions that enhance resilience against similar health shocks, including enhanced food safety, health surveillance and response systems.</p>

        <p>The archipelago of the Comoros is located in the Indian Ocean, north of the Mozambique Channel and northeast of Madagascar. </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>Absent from the political scene since 2006, Azali Assoumani came back and won the presidential elections in 2016. His government introduced a series of fiscal and structural reforms. The national congress, convened in February 2018 to review 42 years of independence and the Presidential Rotation system among the islands, recommended an overhaul of the system of a rotating presidency. Assoumani's mandate was renewed in 2019 after the yes vote in the July 2018-referendum on constitutional reform that expands the power of the presidency.  </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview </b></p>
<p>While the spread of the virus in the Comoros seems to be contained so far, economic activity has strongly slowed. Prior to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the Comoros was still recovering from Cyclone Kenneth (April 2019), with gross domestic product (GDP) growth having fallen to 1.9% in 2019 as a result, from 3.6% in 2018. The pandemic will likely offset the positive impacts from reconstruction efforts after the cyclone, with real GDP growth expected to contract sharply to -1.4% in 2020 (compared to a pre-COVID-19 forecast of 4.4%). </p>
<p>The COVID-19 health crisis is impacting Comoros' economy through various channels. The slowdown of economic activity due to social distancing measures and the disruption of trade and tourism caused by the pandemic constitutes a threat for Comoros' trade and tourism-related sectors. The expected drop of remittances from the diaspora would substantially reduce households' income, especially the poorer ones. Revenues from trade, which represent the bulk of the government's domestic resources, will decrease significantly raising the fiscal deficit. </p>
<p>The fiscal and external financing gaps that COVID-19 pandemic will create are expected to be covered primarily by donor assistance, given still limited borrowing possibilities, with public debt sustainability remaining at moderate levels despite the shock. However, the Comoros' recovery is subject to several vulnerabilities. The current fragile situation of the SNPSF, a money transfer service, could take a sudden turn for the worse and seriously jeopardize financial stability. The possible deterioration of the financial health of state-owned enterprises such as  Comoros Telecom could aggravate the fiscal stance. Notwithstanding, the full economic consequences of COVID-19 are still unclear and subject to high uncertainty around the spread of the disease domestically, as well as overseas. </p>
<p><b>Social Context </b></p>
<p>The Comoros is densely populated, with approximately 465 inhabitants per km2, and more than half of the population (53%) is under the age of 20.  </p>
<p>High population density places intense pressure on natural resources and the environment. Due to its location and topography Comoros is among the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, and 54.2 percent of the population live in at-risk areas. </p>
<p>Nearly one fourth of the population is extremely poor, unable to buy enough food to meet the minimum nutritional requirements of 2,200 kilocalories per person per day. One-fourth of the country's poor citizens currently live just below the national poverty line, and could move out of poverty if their consumption level increased by around KMF 167 per capita (or $0.37) per day. However, about 10% of the population is at risk of falling below the national poverty line in the event of unexpected economic shocks. </p>
<p>While the Comoros compares reasonably well with lower middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the country's Human Capital Index—at 0.41—lags behind the global average for lower-middle income countries. Children in the Comoros can expect to complete 8.4 years of schooling by age 18. Girls receive significantly less education than boys, and the rate of adolescent pregnancies is two to three-times that of aspirational peer countries. Chronic malnutrition leads to 31 out of 100 children growing up stunted, which aggravates existing inequalities in the country.  </p>

        <p>With a population of 5.2 million (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/country/congo-rep?view=chart"">2018</a>) over a surface area of 342,000 km2, the Republic of Congo is sparsely populated, with more than half of the population concentrated in its two largest cities, Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. The rest of the country is one of the least densely populated areas in Africa, with just 12.8 persons per square kilometer.</p>
<p>Largely covered by tropical forests, the Republic of Congo also possesses vast expanses of unused arable land that represent approximately one third of its total area. Moreover, the country ranks among the top 10 of Africa's oil producers and has substantial mineral resources, the majority of which are yet untapped. <b></b></p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who led the People's Republic of the Congo from 1979 to 1992, returned to power in 1997. He won the presidential elections in 2002, 2009, and 2016.</p>
<p>In November 2017, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Congolese Government and representatives of the former rebel leader, Frédéric Bintsamou (known as Pastor Ntoumi), who had reignited a rebellion in the department of Pool following the 2016 presidential elections.</p>
<p>Peace and security have since gradually returned, while the government and the international community strive to consolidate the still-fragile peace in this southern department of the country. A disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) program established under the control of the United Nations is expected to be launched soon.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<ul>
<li>After the profound economic crisis that plagued the country from mid-2014 following the decline in oil prices, the <b>Congolese economy resumed an upward trajectory in 2018</b> with real GDP growth projected to reach 1.6% after two years of negative growth.</li>
<li>Growth was driven by the <b>increase in oil production</b> and by favorable market conditions, with oil prices holding steady in late 2018 and the resumption of demand from partner emerging countries.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, <b>the non-oil sector continues to decline</b>, contracting by 5.5% as a result of the weakening of activity in construction and public works, transport, and telecommunications.</li>
<li>Inflation remained contained at 1.2% in 2018 owing to weak domestic demand and a tightening monetary policy. <b>The country's debt burden has decreased, but remains unsustainable</b> despite the signature of a debt restructuring agreement with China in April 2019. The country will also have to restructure its domestic debt and other commercial debt with oil traders.</li>
<li>
<b>Economic growth is projected to reach 5.4% in 2019,</b> then continue its trajectory, gaining an average of 1.8% per year for the period 2020-21. This outlook is based on a strong hydrocarbon sector and the upturn in investments from 17.1% of GDP in 2018 to 22.7% of GDP in 2019-21, assuming favorable oil prices and budget surpluses.</li>
<li>During the same period, non-oil growth, driven primarily by industry, construction, and agriculture, is expected to average 3%, hinging on restoring the confidence of the private sector and implementing structural reforms aligned with the economic and financial program of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Although the proportion of the population living below the poverty line fell from 51% in 2005 to 41% in 2011, <b>the extreme poverty rate appears to have increased</b> from 2016, especially in rural areas, as a result of the decline in oil prices.</li>
<li>
<b>The poorest 65% of Congolese citizens live in the six regions in the south of the country.</b> Less than 4.9% of them are covered by the social protection programs.</li>
<li>Congo's human capital index stands at <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">0.42</a>, which is below the average for middle-income countries. Despite a slight uptick in per capita income, the country has seen little progress in the areas of health and education. <b>Maternal and infant mortality rates</b> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://databank.worldbank.org/id/2ddc971b?Code=SH.MMR.DTHS&amp;report_name=Gender_Indicators_Report&amp;populartype=series""><b>remain high</b></a>, <b>with 5% of children not making it to their fifth birthday.</b> Chronic malnutrition affects 21% of children, and only 30% of primary students have achieved the required proficiency level in mathematics, 40% in French.</li>

        <p>Gabon, a central African country, is rich in natural resources. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, it borders Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo. It is sparsely populated, with a population of 2 million (2017) and forests covering 85% of its territory.</p>
<p>Gabon nonetheless has one of the highest urbanization rates in Africa; more than four in five Gabonese citizens live in cities. The capital, Libreville, and Port Gentil—the economic capital of the country—are home to 59% of the population. One in two Gabonese citizens is under the age of 20, with the fertility rate in urban areas at four children per woman against six in rural areas, according to the 2012 Second Demographic and Health Survey.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>The Gabonese Democratic Party (<i>Parti démocratique gabonais</i> PDG) dominates the political landscape: Omar Bongo held the presidency for 41 years (1968–2009), and his son, Ali Bongo Ondimba, won the presidential elections in August 2009, against the backdrop of social crisis.</p>
<p>The opposition boycotted legislative elections in 2011, but later competed in municipal and departmental elections in December 2013 and in the Senate election in December 2014. Still, all these elections were won by the party in power. On August 31, 2016, the incumbent president, Ali Bongo, was re-elected in controversial elections marked by a fairly low voter turnout of 59%.</p>
<p>Legislative and municipal elections were held in October 2018. The ruling party—despite losing 15 seats—maintained its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, winning 98 of 143 seats.  The elections followed an April 2018 constitutional court ruling that dissolved parliament (because elections had been postponed for too long) and forced the government's resignation in May. A caretaker government has taken measures (contained in the new 2018 Budget Law) to address slippage in Gabon's macroeconomic performance and contain its bloated wage bill.</p>
<p>On January 7, 2019, taking advantage of a prolonged absence by the President of the Republic, who was convalescing in Morocco, several soldiers attempted to seize power. This attempted coup culminated in the arrest of its ringleaders.</p>
<p>A new government was sworn in on January 12, 2019, then reorganized by presidential decree on January 30 and June 10, 2019.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>Gabon is an upper-middle-income country. <b>The fifth largest oil producer in Africa</b>, it has had strong economic growth over the past decade, driven by its production of oil and manganese. The oil sector has accounted for 80% of exports, 45% of GDP, and 60% of fiscal revenue on average over the past five years. However, as the country is facing a <b>decline in its oil reserves</b>, the Gabonese government has decided to diversify its economy.</p>
<p>Gabon's fiscal position worsened in 2015, with the country recording a <b>fiscal deficit for the first time since 1998. </b>Despite the government's attempts to rein in expenditure and offset the decline in oil revenue, Gabon's economy stalled in 2017 and was projected to grow by <b>0.8% in 2018 compared to 0.5% in 2017.</b></p>
<p>This trend is attributable to limited expansion of the secondary and tertiary sectors, impacted by the decline in public expenditure. However, higher prices for crude oil, manganese, and rubber—exported by the country—contributed to growth in the primary sector. <b>Growth could rebound to 2.9% in 2019,</b> driven by non-extractive sectors like agribusiness and upgraded transport and communication networks.</p>
<p>The government has launched an audit of the public service payroll: its initial steps included the decision to pay civil servants with vouchers and to carry out physical-presence checks to identify ghost workers. The cabinets of the President and the Prime Minister have reduced their staff by 40%. The government also extended the hiring freeze for another three years—except for social sectors.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>The poor quality of Gabon's business climate is a major barrier to the diversification of its economy. Gabon ranked 169 out of 190 countries in the <i>2018 Doing Business</i> report. The government's strategy for the promotion of non-oil sectors has so far been based on the granting of specific incentives to foreign investors. A recent World Bank policy note highlighted the importance of improving human capital, building a fair and transparent business environment, and improving the quality and cost of core infrastructure—three critical building blocks for economic and export diversification. Recent measures to improve the business climate include a one-stop shop for investors; a public-private partnership (PPP) framework; a domestic arbitration court; and codes for hydrocarbons and mining.</p>
<p>Gabon must also boost its social expenditure. A 2013 McKinsey report suggests that roughly 30% of the population faces vulnerability, surviving on monthly incomes below the guaranteed minimum wage of CFAF 80,000 (approximately $150). The study also notes that the social situation has deteriorated in terms of access to basic social services (health care, drinking water, and electricity) in 60% of the regions.</p>
<p>Following this report, Gabon decided to improve its social policy by focusing on three pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing integrated social programs for the most vulnerable (the elderly, orphans, the disabled;</li>
<li>Creating income-generating activities for the poorest population groups; and</li>
<li>Reducing inequalities in access to basic public services. Although the net primary enrollment rate is one of the highest in Africa (96.4%), the completion rate in the Gabonese education system is low (37.2%).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>weakness of the national statistical system</b> is another challenge Gabon needs to address, as reliable data on poverty and income distribution are not available; the most recent date back to 2010. The consumer price index is still based on household consumption from a 2003 survey.</p>

        <p>The Gambia is a small, fragile country in West Africa. Stretching 450 km along the Gambia River, the country  (all 10,689 square kilometers of it) is surrounded by Senegal, except for a 60-km Atlantic Ocean front. The country has a population of 2.1 million. With 176 people per square kilometer, it is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Most of the population (57%) is concentrated around urban and peri-urban centers. </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>The December 2016 presidential election resulted in a political transition after the incumbent, President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh who had led the country for 22 years, was defeated by Adama Barrow, the presidential candidate of a political coalition. </p>
<p>Parliamentary elections in April 2017 led to an absolute majority for the United Democratic Party (UDP) with 31 seats in the 58-seat National Assembly. The former ruling Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) party was reduced to five seats. Local elections in May 2018 resulted in 62 of 120 seats going to the UDP and 18 to the APRC. </p>
<p>In December 2019, President Adama Barrow formed a new political party, the National People's Party, which would allow him to seek a second term in the 2021 elections. A new draft Constitution, which introduces a two-term limit for the presidency, was delivered in November 2019 and is pending approval by the National Assembly and endorsement by the Gambian people through a referendum.  </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview </b></p>
<p>Following strong performance under the 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program , with a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, and debt relief from key plurilateral and bilateral creditors, The Gambia has been able to exit from debt distress. This has paved the way for an Enhanced Credit Facility approved by the IMF Board on March 23, 2020. The fiscal deficit has been reduced from 6.2% of GDP in 2018 to 2.6% of GDP in 2019, supported by increased tax revenues and strong donor inflows. Growth has remained robust at around 6% despite the fiscal adjustment and external shocks, including in the tourism sector. International reserves have been brought closer to prudential levels, interest rates have eased, and inflation has remained stable. </p>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have severe socioeconomic consequences. GDP growth is projected to decline to between 2.5 and -2.4% in 2020. Heavily dependent on tourism, The Gambia is mainly impacted by a reduction in tourists, particularly from key markets in Europe, but also from trade disruption and lower commodity prices. Limited fiscal, monetary, and financial buffers and high risk of debt distress limit room to maneuver. Health sector capacity is weak and social safety nets do not exist.  </p>
<p>The government has taken some steps to protect lives and livelihoods during the relief period with support from development partners. The World Bank is providing support through its $10 million COVID-19 Emergency Response Project, and the IMF through its US$21.2 million Rapid Credit Facility. Moreover, the IMF has approved the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust debt relief ($2.9 million). The European Union has disbursed a $9.7 million budget support grant, while the World Bank Social Safety Net Project has been front loaded with an additional $6 million.  </p>
<p>The Gambia also seeks debt service deferral under the G20 initiative that could provide between $2.19 million from the creditors already endorsing the initiative to close to $6.68 million if the plurilateral and private creditors endorse the initiative. </p>

        <p>Madagascar, an island country located  in the Indian ocean off the coast from southern Africa, is the fifth largest island in the world, with a land mass of 587,000 km2 and 25.6 million inhabitants. Despite having considerable natural resources, Madagascar has among the highest poverty rates in the world.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Presidential elections were held peacefully in January 2019, marking the first political alternation of power in Madagascar. President Rajoelina won 55.6% of the votes and leads the country alongside his Prime Minister, Christian Ntsay and 24 ministers.</p></li>
<li><p>Some ministries were merged to improve the efficiency of public administration. The Malagasy government is finalizing its new 2019-2023 Emergency Plan aimed at stimulating the economy and reducing poverty. </p></li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p>Legislative elections held on May 27, 2019 delivered a massive victory to President Andry Rajoelina's support platform, with 84 of the National Assembly's 151 seats. Commune-level elections, held on November 27, 2019, to elect 1,695 mayors followed suit and  President Andry Rajoelina's platform gained seats in the majority of cities..</p></li></ul>
<p><b>Economic Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prior to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, Madagascar was on an upward growth trajectory. Following a prolonged period of political instability and economic stagnation, growth accelerated over the last five years to reach an estimated 4.8% in 2019, its fastest pace in over a decade. The return to constitutional order and peaceful political transition in  the last elections was instrumental to this economic revival, as it contributed to restore investor confidence, reopen access to key export markets, reinstate flows of concessional financing, and encourage structural reforms. These positive trends were also reflected in improved labor market conditions and declining poverty rates, although around 75% of the population was still estimated to live below the international poverty line of $1.90 in 2019, significantly higher than the regional average of 41%.</p></li>
<li><p>The adverse economic, social, and fiscal impact of the COVID-19 crisis will be very substantial in 2020. Global trade and travel disruptions as well as domestic containment measures are expected to result in a sharp deceleration in economic activity in 2020, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth predicted to slow to 1.2%, compared to an estimated growth rate of 5.2% just prior to the outbreak. Vulnerable populations in urban areas are particularly exposed to economic hardship and poverty traps in these  circumstances. Sharply declining tax revenues and COVID-19-related spending will widen the fiscal deficit and create a sudden increase in financing needs. </p></li>
<li><p>These developments emphasize the importance of implementing robust emergency measures to save lives, protect vulnerable populations, and safeguard jobs in the short term as well as accelerate reforms to stimulate investment for long-term recovery, strengthen resilience to future shocks, and maintain public debt at a sustainable course. The World Bank is committed to working with the government to achieve those objectives with the fully array of its instruments. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Social Context and Development Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The country's <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital/brief/about-hcp"">human capital index</a> ranking is among the lowest worldwide, and Madagascar has the world's fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition, with almost one child in two under five years of age suffering from stunting. An estimated 1.4 million children dropped out of primary school in 2012.</p></li>
<li><p>Living conditions remain difficult for the vast majority of the population, with a low rate of access to electricity (13%) in particular.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Madagascar is one of the African countries most severely affected by climate change impacts and experiences an average of three cyclones per year.</p>

        <p>With a population of almost 130 million, a rich cultural history and diversity, and abundant natural resources, Mexico is among the world's 15 largest economies in the world and the second largest economy in Latin America. The country has strong macroeconomic institutions and it is open to trade.  </p>
<p>Over the last three decades Mexico has underperformed in terms of growth, inclusion and poverty reduction compared to similar countries.   Its economic growth averaged just above 2 percent a year between 1980 and 2018, limiting progress in convergence relative to high income economies.</p>
<p>Beyond the health and human life consequences, which are massive across countries, the COVID-19 pandemic brought demand and supply shocks to the Mexican economy with deep impacts on firms, employment, and households. The combination of the global recession (including a drop in U.S. output, Mexico's main trading partner), disruptions in global and domestic supply chains, measures to flatten the contagion curve, financial disruptions and investment risk aversion, among other, are likely to take heavy toll on the key components of aggregate demand. In this context, a significant contraction of the economy is expected for 2020.</p>

<p>Moldova is a small lower-middle-income economy. Although it is among the poorest countries in Europe, it has made significant progress in reducing poverty and promoting inclusive growth since the early 2000s. The economy has expanded by an average of 4.6 percent annually in the past 20 years, driven by consumption and fueled by remittances. The latter account for 10 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>A closer integration with Europe has anchored successive governments' policy reform agendas, but reforms that are good on paper face implementation challenges. A vulnerable political system, a polarized society, low productivity, demographic challenges, skills mismatches, and a high vulnerability to both climate-related and external shocks are Moldova's biggest economic challenges.</p>
<p>Moldova's large-scale out-migration, combined with decreasing fertility rates, has led to an alarming decline in the population and increased the share of elderly people. This puts pressure on the pension system and limits the available labor force and the country's long-term competitiveness.</p>
<p>Continuing economic stabilization, improving living standards, and creating a rule-based business environment are the country's key goals.</p>
<p>In the near term, the Government has the task of taking the country through the COVID-19 crisis without reversing hard-won structural reforms, while regaining trust among citizens and international partners, combating corruption, ensuring transparent and fair presidential elections, and completing the unfinished reform agenda.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blogs.worldbank.org/eastasiapacific/category/tags/mongolia-25-years-25-days"">Over the past 25 years</a>, Mongolia has transformed into a vibrant democracy, tripling its GDP per capita since 1991. Primary school enrollments are at 97%, coupled with impressive declines in maternal and child mortality (45 per 100,000 live births in 2017 and 16 per 1,000 live births in 2018 respectively). With vast agricultural, livestock and mineral resources and an increasingly educated population, Mongolia's development prospects look promising in the long-term assuming the continuation of structural reforms. </p>
<p>After growing close to 6 percent on average in 2017-19, the  economy is likely to contract in 2020 amid adverse impacts of the COVID-19 global pandemic and pre-existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities. It would be the first contraction since the global financial crisis in 2009. The fiscal gains of the past three years are being rapidly eroded by unprecedented revenue losses (mainly driven by a large contraction in the trade flows) and spending increase (including health care costs and capex as well as fiscal relief measures). The government debt as a share of GDP is likely to rise again in 2020, reversing the downward trend of recent years. External sector pressures are likely to mount, due to weaker export earnings, lower foreign investments and health-related imports supported by the fiscal stimulus. A recent survey by the Mongolian Chamber of Commerce (MCC) indicated that about that about 8,000 jobs have been lost since the COVID-19 outbreak. This trend is likely to continue, contributing to further increase in unemployment rate and reversing recent progress on poverty reduction. In addition, inflation would probably remain under the central bank target mostly driven by weak domestic demand and lower oil prices,</p>
<p>However, unless the impact of COVID-19 is prolonged locally and globally, growth is expected to accelerate in the medium term, largely supported by robust growth in private consumption and continued steady investment in mining and manufacturing. This prospect is predicated on the government's continued commitment to fiscal consolidation to contain public debt in the medium term by improving revenue mobilization and controlling public spending once the impact of the COVID-19 shock on the economy wanes.</p>
<p>Other risks to the outlook include lingering impact of the COVID-19, notably on the commodity market, climate shocks (drought/flooding, harsh winter), possible relaxation of the government's commitment to reforms after the COVID-19 shock, uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of the U.S.A.-China trade deal and limited progress on banking sector reforms as well as on addressing anti-money laundering issues.</p>
<p>Mongolia's official national poverty rate has fluctuated since 2010. The poverty headcount rate declined sharply from 38.8% to 21.6% during the economic boom in 2010-2014. However, between 2016 and 2018, poverty reduction was uneven, declining in rural but not in urban areas. Growth in rural areas was faster and favorable to the poor, contributing to reducing rural poverty from 34.9% in 2016 to 30.8% in 2018 supported by rising livestock prices and expansion of poverty-targeted social protection programs.</p>
<p>By contrast, the urban poverty rate remained unchanged at 27% from 2016 to 2018, mainly driven by stagnant wage growth in the poorest population group. Consequently, poverty is increasingly concentrated in urban areas. In the coming years, fiscally sustainable labor and poverty-targeted social protection policies coupled with a positive economic outlook will be key to reducing poverty.</p>
<p>To ensure sustainable and inclusive growth and to reduce poverty, Mongolia will also need to strengthen governance; build institutional capacity to manage public revenues efficiently; allocate its resources effectively among spending, investing, and saving; and ensure equal opportunities to all its citizens in urban and rural areas. </p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>The COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated rapidly since the end of the lockdown Morocco imposed in March. As a result, the months of August and September saw a spike in coronavirus cases, with the Casablanca-Settat region largely dominating the daily COVID contamination scores, and the city of Casablanca and other COVID hotbeds often subject to temporary lockdown measures. By October 14, Morocco had recorded over 2,700 coronavirus deaths and more than 160,000 confirmed cases of infection. The government's state-of-health emergency, in force since mid-March, has been extended to November 10. In his August address to the nation, King Mohammed VI warned Morocco could return to total lockdown if the upward trend of coronavirus infections continued.</p>
<p>At the end of July, the King had announced a new roadmap to boost recovery and spur inclusive growth, inviting the government to develop a plan to meet its objectives. These include: health coverage for all Moroccans within a 5-year timeframe; the expansion of social welfare to vulnerable segments of the population; the reform of state-owned enterprises; and bold measures to boost recovery, including the setting up of a strategic investment fund worth US$4.8 billion to help enterprises and individuals recover from the impact of the coronavirus. On August 4, the government unveiled a detailed plan to address these priorities.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Commission for the New Development Model (established in December 2019) is continuing to work on forging a path for Morocco's long-term development. The coronavirus—and the implications it has on the country's development model and economic trajectory—means the monarchy has given the Commission an extra 6 months (up to December 2020) to deliver it.</p>
<p>To help Morocco cope with the effects of COVID-19, the World Bank restructured, in April 2020, a US$275 million Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan, with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO). This added a health-related trigger to allow immediate funding for emergency measures. In addition, in June 2020, the World Bank granted a US$48 million loan to support the government health sector's response to COVID-19 by strengthening measures of prevention for infection, as well as its detection, surveillance, and case management.</p>
<p>On the economic front, the COVID-19 shock has pushed the Moroccan economy abruptly into a severe recession—the first recession since 1995. Economic output contracted by 13.8% in the second quarter, primarily as a result of the lockdown but also because of a sharp reduction in exports caused by the disruption of global value chains, collapse of tourism receipts, and a fall in remittances. The shocks to supply and demand triggered by the pandemic have been compounded by the underperformance of the agricultural sector as a result of an unusually dry winter. In this context, in H1-2020 the unemployment rate increased from 8.1% to 12.3%. The Moroccan authorities have adopted a number of measures to mitigate the impact of these shocks on households and companies, including: direct transfers to formal and informal workers; issuing partial guarantees to banks for loans granted to firms; a reduction in the Central Bank's benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points (to a historically low 1.5%); and direct injections of liquidity into the financial system.</p>
<p>The COVID shock is leading to an amplification of Morocco's twin deficits, thus increasing the country's financing needs. The fiscal consolidation efforts undertaken by the authorities in recent years have been discontinued as current expenditure on health and social protection have had to be increased substantially to respond to the pandemic. Recession has resulted in a shortfall of tax revenues, mainly from customs duties, goods and services, income and profits—all of which will increase the budget deficit. On the external front, Morocco's open economy is highly exposed to international shocks and especially to adverse developments in the eurozone area. During the first half of 2020, a sharp decrease—in remittances (-8.1%), tourism (-33.2%), and exports (-18.3%)—has had an adverse impact on the country's current account.</p>
<p>Real GDP is projected to contract by 6.3% in 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic but also to poor rain. In turn, the fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 7.6% of GDP in 2020 which, together with the recession, will result in a substantial increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Finally, the decline in exports, tourism receipts, and remittances could increase the current account deficit to 9.9% of GDP. In line with the rest of the world, the Moroccan economy is expected to rebound in 2021, something that should help contain the budget and current account deficits. The pace and length of recovery are, however, subject to a high degree of uncertainty, related to the epidemiological evolution of the pandemic and the future performance of Morocco's main trading partners. </p>

        <p>Prior to the impacts of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic and, despite economic growth lost momentum in the last years, Panama has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6 percent over the last five years.</p>
<p>The effects of the pandemic on the Panamanian economy are expected to be significant, with main macroeconomic indicators affected. The country fiscal position will be deteriorated due to the contraction of the aggregate demand and a sharp decline in government revenues as a result of the economy slowdown and tax deferment, and in the face of strong increasing levels of public expenditures, because of the health and social protection programs.</p>
<p>Growth in Panama for 2020 is expected to contract significantly, with main employment areas such as services and construction impacted. Although most sectors have been hit, positive contributions to growth are expected to come from public expenditure, with subsequent increase in the fiscal deficit and public debt. A slight recovery is expected during 2021, driven by a rebound in trade, leading to the resumption of key services such as transport, logistics, and other sectors connected to the Canal, as well as construction and mining, combined with improvements in domestic consumption and investments.</p>
<p>Panama has made significant progress in reducing poverty in recent years in part due to economic growth and public transfers. Between 2015 and 2018, poverty at US$ 5.5 fell from 15.4 to 12.6 percent while extreme poverty at US$ 3.2 declined from 6.7 to 5.2 percent. </p>
<p>However, poverty has only marginally decreased in 2019 and will expectedly increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, wiping out the gains in poverty reductions, and sharpening poverty and inequity disparities within most vulnerable groups such as indigenous people and afro descendants.</p>
<p>Access to basic services is not universal and remains linked to factors such as geographic location, education levels, ethnicity and income levels of households. There are huge dichotomies between the rural and urban areas: poverty prevails in rural areas, mainly inhabited by indigenous people and afro descendants. For example, there are 11 years less in life expectancy for Indigenous women and men living in their territories (67.75) versus the overall population (79); and the maternal mortality rate is higher in Indigenous women who live in their territories versus the national average for all women (392  Darien vs. 35.4 per 100,000 births).</p>
<p>These disparities are expected to exacerbate in the short and medium term as a consequence of the COVID-19, which could result in a rise in food insecurity and thus in chronic and severe child malnutrition, as well as micronutrient deficiencies, especially in rural areas, which threaten recent gains. Similarly, the pandemic has also left almost one million students out of school, with the consequent impacts in learning results and knowledges losses, effects that are likewise bearing disproportionate to the students with less resources.</p>
<p>Sustaining high and inclusive growth over the medium to long term will require responding to historical limitations. These include improving basic social services, such as education, health, water and sanitation, mainly in vulnerable populations; strengthening the skills and the effectiveness of public institutions; as well as the provision of key infrastructure. Furthermore, human capital must begin to play a bigger role.</p>

        <p>Small and landlocked, Rwanda is hilly and fertile with a densely packed population of about 12.5 million people (2018). It borders the far larger and richer Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as its closest East African neighbors, Tanzania, Uganda, and Burundi.</p>
<p>With the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Rwanda has been able to make important economic and structural reforms and sustain its economic growth rates over the last decade.</p>
<p><b>Political Context<br></b>Rwanda has guarded its political stability since the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. Parliamentary elections in September 2018 saw women fill 64% of the seats, the Rwandan Patriotic Front maintain an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies and, for the first time, two opposition parties, the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda and Social Party Imberakuri, winning two seats each in the parliament. President Paul Kagame was re-elected to a seven-year term in the August 2018, following an amendment to the constitution in December 2015 allowing him to serve a third term.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview<br></b>Rwanda now aspires to reach Middle Income Country (MIC) status by 2035 and High-Income Country (HIC) status by 2050. This aspiration will be carried out through a series of seven-year <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/fileadmin/user_upload/NST1_7YGP_Final.pdf"">National Strategies for Transformation (NST1)</a>, underpinned by detailed sectoral strategies that are aimed toward achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>The NST1 came after the implementation of two, five-year Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies—EDPRS (2008-12) and EDPRS-2 (2013-18), under which Rwanda experienced robust economic and social performances. Growth averaged 7.5% over the decade to 2018, while per capita growth domestic product (GDP) grew at 5% annually.</p>
<p><b>COVID-19</b><br>Rwanda was in the middle of an economic boom prior to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Economic growth exceeded 10% in 2019, driven mostly by large public investments for implementation of the National Strategy of Transformation. Strong growth was expected to continue in 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic has disrupted international flows of goods and services with significant spillovers to the broader global economy. Exports and tourism are taking a strong hit amid disruption in international trade and travel. Rwanda is already feeling mounting balance of payment and fiscal pressures. This could negatively impact the provision of public health services with respect to COVID-19 response and preparedness capacity, as well as adversely affect the provision of other essential health service delivery in Rwanda, as healthcare workers and fiscal resources are redirected to the emergency response. </p>
<p>To help the government prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by the pandemic, and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, the World Bank Group provided $14.25 million International Development Association credit in immediate funding to a new operation, the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/07/world-bank-group-supports-rwanda-covid-19-response"">Rwanda COVID-19 Emergency Response Project</a>.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges<br></b>Public investments have been the main driver of growth in recent years. External financing through grants, concessional and non-concessional borrowing played an important role in financing of public investments. Growth slowdown of 2016 and 2017 highlighted the limits of public sector-led growth model. Going forward, the private sector will play a bigger role in helping to ensure economic growth. Low domestic savings, skills, and the high cost of energy are some of the major constraints to private investment. Stronger dynamism in the private sector will help to sustain high investment rate and accelerate the growth. Promoting domestic savings is viewed as critical.  </p>
<p><b>Social Context</b><br>Rwanda's strong economic growth was accompanied by substantial improvements in living standards, with a two-thirds drop in child mortality and near-universal primary school enrollment. A strong focus on homegrown policies and initiatives has contributed to significant improvement in access to services and human development indicators. Measured by the national poverty line, poverty declined from 77% in 2001 to 55% in 2017, while Life expectancy at birth improved from 29 in the mid-1990s to 69 in 2019. The maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 1,270 per 100,000 live births in the 1990s to 290 in 2019. The official inequality measure, the Gini index, declined from 0.52 in 2006 to 0.43 in 2017. </p>

        <p>Located in the most western part of Africa, Senegal is bordered by Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and Mauritania and surrounds its much smaller Anglophone neighbor, Gambia. With its tropical and dry climate, Senegal is home to 15.4 million people, a quarter of whom live in the region of the capital Dakar on 0.3% of the territory. </p>
<p><b>Political Context </b></p>
<p>Senegal is among Africa's most stable countries, with three major peaceful political transitions since independence in 1960. The February 2019 presidential election saw President Macky Sall win a second term. He has been in office since 2012, but his second term will be shorter due to a March 2016 referendum that reduced the presidential term from seven to five years.  </p>
<p>In 2017, the ruling coalition <i>Benno Bokk Yakaar</i> party (“United in Hope"" in the widely-spoken Wolof language) won 125 of 165 seats of the national assembly. A dozen other parties also hold seats. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, local and legislative elections could be twinned in 2022. </p>
<p>Senegal has so far been spared regional security shocks, but activism by terrorist groups in neighboring countries and cross-border traffic are factors that risk fueling instability. </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview </b></p>
<p>Senegal's economic growth has been among the highest in Africa between 2014 and 2018, remaining above 6% annually. GDP growth was 5.3% in 2019, down from 6.3% in 2017. The services sector continues to be the largest contributor to GDP growth, while on the demand side, investment (+12.5%) and exports (+7.2%) were the strongest growth drivers.  </p>
<p>Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed Senegal's economic outlook. Growth has slowed significantly to an estimated 1.3% percent in 2020, with services (such as tourism and transport) and exports particularly hard hit. Senegal has responded with containment measures and a comprehensive economic stimulus plan (PRES) to protect lives and livelihoods. However, limited fiscal buffers and safety nets, a vulnerable healthcare system, and a large informal sector pose challenges. </p>
<p>Economic recovery will likely be gradual, driven by a robust return of private consumption and investment. Reforms envisioned under the Senegal Emerging Plan (PSE) need to be deepened for growth to resume its pre-pandemic trajectory. Significant crowding in of private investment is central to increasing Senegal's productive capacity and supporting export growth. Services remain the main contributor to GDP, and the primary sector (agriculture, in particular) the most dynamic growth driver. Oil and gas developments have been delayed due to COVID-19 and are expected to contribute to revenues and exports only around 2025. </p>
<p><b>Development challenges</b>: Senegal's key development challenge is to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 while enabling sustainable and inclusive long-term growth, characterized by the following:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Improving resilience to macro-fiscal, environmental, and social risks to safeguard investments in human capital and household livelihood </li>
<li>Boosting and protecting human capital for productivity growth </li>
<li>Enhancing competitiveness and job creation through improving digital and physical connectivity at the national and regional levels, increasing efficiency of labor markets, lowering energy costs and carbon footprint and optimizing the energy mix, promoting the service economy, and  boosting the productivity and competitiveness of agriculture and related value chains  </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Social context </b></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic risks jeopardizing  welfare gains achieved through improved access to key services and connectivity,  in terms of both affordability and infrastructure deployment. This could generate severe welfare losses for households through shortfalls in labor and non-labor income (particularly private money transfers), domestic prices inflation, and disruptions in basic services. </p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p><b>Macroeconomic Context</b></p>
<p>After slowing to 3.5% in 2018 from 3.8% in the previous year, economic growth in Sierra Leone is projected to rebound to 4.8% in 2019 driven by increased activities in agriculture and construction as well as the resumption of iron ore production and exports. Growth in these labor-intensive sectors could make a dent on poverty which remains widespread in the country (more than half of the population lives in poverty, according to the latest Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey (SLIHS)). The SLIHS 2018 will inform in the next few months the evolution of poverty in the country since 2011. Agriculture will continue to drive the non-iron ore gross domestic product (GDP) growth, with the sector expected to grow by 4.2% in 2019, spurred by increased investments and expansion in the crops, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors. The growth in services is expected to slow due to weaker performance in tourism, transportation and communication.</p>
<p>The macroeconomic situation remained challenging during the first half of 2019 (2019H1) as inflationary pressure and exchange rate depreciation increased. Inflation, which moderated from 18.2 to 16.8% in 2018, increased to 17.2% in 2019H1 reflecting a sharp depreciation of exchange rate and elevated nonfood prices due mainly to the increase in fuel prices. The Leone came under intense pressure in 2019H1, depreciating by 4.8% and 6.5% (YoY) at the official and parallel markets, respectively, reflecting lower-than-expected export receipts and donor inflows as well as increased demand for foreign exchange to finance imports.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit will continue to improve as the government strengthens its fiscal consolidation measures. The overall fiscal deficit will narrow from 5.7% of GDP to 3.4% due mainly to increased revenue mobilization and expenditure management. Total revenue is expected to increase from 14.9% of GDP to 15.7% in 2019 as the government continues to implement its medium-term revenue mobilization strategy, which includes automation of customs documentation and tax processes and improving the operations of the treasury single account. Tax revenues are therefore expected to increase to 14.0% of GDP from 13.7% in the previous year.</p>
<p>Total public debt is estimated to increase from 60.9% of GDP in 2018 to 62.3% of GDP in 2019, reflecting depreciation of the exchange rate as well as increased domestic debt on account of the conversion of stock of arrears into debt. The country remains at a “high risk” of debt distress for both external public debt and overall public debt. The current account deficit of the balance of payments is expected to narrow to 11.4% of GDP in 2019 helped by the slowdown in imports, which will more than offset the continued sluggish exports. Gross external reserves increased slightly to US$500m (3.4 months of import) in 2019H1 from $483m in 2018 (3.3 months of import).</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Sierra Leone held general elections on March 7, 2018 to elect a new President, Members of Parliament and Local Councils in the fourth cycle of elections since the civil war in 2002. The opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) candidate, Rtd. Brig. Julius Maada Bio won by 0.6 percentage points and for the first time a winning party failed to have majority in Parliament. The losing All People's Congress (APC) had 68 seats (52%) and the SLPP had 49 seats (37%). Two new parties – the Coalition for Change (C4C) and the National Grand Coalition (NGC) – won eight and four seats respectively.</p>
<p>However, the ruling party petitioned the election of 16 opposition MPs and the High Court ruled in its favor, nullifying the election of 10 – the seats of eight were awarded to the ruling party while two were to be re-run. The ruling party won the re-run in Constituency 040 held on September 14, while the opposition won a by-election in Constituency 043. The ruling party now has a majority with 59 seats and the main opposition has 58 seats. One re-run by-election is pending, the outcome of which may produce an equal number of representatives (59-59 should the opposition win) or add to the ruling party's majority (60 if it wins).</p>
<p>The government early this year launched three Commissions of Inquiry to probe into the governance activities of the past administration: 2007-2018. Persons of Interest include former president, vice presidents, ministers, deputies, and other civil and public servants. The Commissions are expected to conclude hearings by end of October with recommendations presented to government by end of 2019.</p>
<p><b>Development Challenges</b></p>
<p>Until the outbreak of Ebola in May 2014, Sierra Leone was seeking to attain middle-income status by 2035, but the country still carries its post-conflict attributes of high youth unemployment, corruption and weak governance. The country continues to face the daunting challenge of enhancing transparency in managing its natural resources and creating fiscal space for development. Problems of poor infrastructure and widespread rural and urban impoverishment persist despite remarkable strides and reforms.</p>

        <p><b>CONTEXT</b></p>
<p>Tanzania's solid macroeconomic performance during the past six years is being put to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the poverty rate in the country has declined, the absolute number of poor citizens has not because of the high population growth rate. The country's overall population is about 58 million (2019).  </p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>In October 2015, H.E John Pombe Magufuli was elected the fifth president of the United Republic of Tanzania. Magufuli's Fifth-Phase Government has prioritized efforts to clampdown on corruption, improve public administration and manage public resources for improved social outcomes. The 2020 Worldwide Governance Indicators show Tanzania has either deteriorated or has been stagnant in all governance indicators between 2012 and 2019 (except for control of corruption). The strongest decline has been in voice and accountability, in political stability/violence and rule of law. On October 28, 2020, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held both in mainland Tanzania and in the semi-autonomous region of Zanzibar.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>Reflecting strong income growth over the past decade, on July 1, 2020 the World Bank announced that Tanzania's gross national income (GNI) per capita increased from $1,020 in 2018 to $1,080 in 2019, exceeding the threshold for lower-middle income status. The country's broad vision of its development goals as a middle-income country in 2025 are set out in the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, characterized by high-quality livelihoods; peace, stability, and unity; good governance; a well-educated and learning society; and a competitive economy capable of sustainable growth and shared benefits. Increased GNI per capita is impressive but not enough to reach these goals. Investing in both human development and physical capital is key to achieving these broad goals and improving the quality of life for all Tanzanians. </p>
<p>Most recently the economy has been significantly challenged by the ongoing pandemic, especially in sectors reliant on global demand. Inflation has been low and stable, but Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2020. Tourism, a major contributor to GDP growth, has declined significantly despite the country reopening for tourism in June and is expected to underperform during the peak season of July–October. Leading indicators of private domestic demand show a deceleration. Domestic credit growth has slowed to 6.9% in January–June 2020 from 8.9% in the first half of 2019. Imports of capital goods, a major component of private investment, declined by about 24% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020. Business expectations for sales and employment for the next six months are pessimistic. Political uncertainty surrounding general elections may also be contributing to a delay in private investment this year.</p>
<p>The current economic outlook is highly uncertain, and risks are tilted to the downside. A protracted global health crisis that continues in 2021 could undermine global demand and thus the Tanzanian economy. Even if the global health crisis is contained, additional trade and logistics restrictions could continue disrupting global trade during the recovery. A full recovery in 2021–2022 requires government attention to reforms to improve the business environment as a key input to bolster recovery of the private sector. Tanzania trails its regional peers in terms of actual reforms. According the World Bank <i>Doing Business Report 2020</i>, Tanzania ranks 141 out of 190 economies in ease to doing business, trailing Rwanda, Kenya, and Uganda and Sub-Saharan peers like Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique. Reforms for a more favorable and predictable business environment are needed, particularly in terms of business regulation as per the government's ""<i>Blueprint for regulatory reforms to improve the business environment.""</i></p>
<p><b>Social Context</b></p>
<p>The December 2019 <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/tanzania/publication/tanzanias-path-to-poverty-reduction-and-pro-poor-growth"">Tanzania Mainland Poverty Assessment</a> notes that despite sustained economic growth and a persistent decline in poverty, the absolute number of poor people grew from 13 million in 2007, to 14 million today. Vulnerability is also still high: for every four Tanzanians who moved out of poverty, three fell into it. A large number of non-poor people living just above the poverty line are at risk of slipping below it. Beyond the persistent gaps between urban and rural areas, there are large disparities in the distribution of poverty across geographic regions. Poverty is highly concentrated in the western and lake zones, and lowest in the eastern zones.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Located on Africa's west coast, Togo is bordered by Ghana, Benin, and Burkina Faso and is home to approximately <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/country/togo?view=chart"">7.8</a> million people. Although the poverty rate fell from 61.7% in 2006 to 53.5% in 2017, poverty and inequality remain extremely high, particularly in rural areas where <b>69% of households were living below the poverty line in 2015</b>.</p>
<p>This is largely attributable to a high annual population growth rate of 2.5% that is outpacing development progress, concentrated economic growth in the modern sectors, and limited access to quality services.  Poverty is also higher in female-headed households (57.5%),  <b>and vulnerability is higher among women because they have fewer economic opportunities.</b></p>
<p>Togo's score on the human capital index <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">(HCI)</a> remains low at 0.41. This means that children born in Togo today will be only 41% as productive when they grow up as they could be if they had access to good health, education, and nutrition.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>The ruling <i>Union pour la République</i> (UNIR) party has dominated the political scene for several years, and won 59 of the 91 seats in the National Assembly in the 2018 legislative elections. Presidential elections held on February 22, 2020 returned the incumbent, Faure Gnassingbé, to power.  At the helm since 2005, Gnassingbé is now serving his fourth five-year term.</p>
<p>On September 28, 2020, Victoire Tomégah-Dogbé was appointed Prime Minister, becoming the first woman to hold this position in Togo's political history.<br>For the first time in 32 years, Togo held local elections in June 2019 to elect municipal councilors. The UNIR secured a majority, winning 878 of the 1,490 seats.</p>
<p><b>Economic Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The COVID-19 pandemic could slow the economic momentum of recent years.</b> Despite the unfavorable international economic conditions, marked by heightened trade tensions and a persistent security threat, Togo's economy continued to perform well in 2019, with an <b>estimated 5.3%</b> growth rate that was driven by an upturn in public investment, expansion in the construction sector, and improved agricultural productivity. The <b>services sector </b>nevertheless remains the main engine of growth thanks to expanding port and airport operations. However, the crisis triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to a decline in growth to 1% in 2020.</li>
<li>
<b>Inflation returned to negative territory in December 2019, </b>driven by an ample food supply owing to increased agricultural productivity and lower communication costs. Average annual inflation dipped slightly from 0.9% in 2018 to 0.7% in 2019.</li>
<li>A rebound in capital goods imports and a reduction in exports <b>increased the current transactions deficit from 3.5% of GDP in 2018 to 4% in 2019</b>. Foreign direct investments and concessional loans helped finance the current account deficit.  Reforms to improve public financial management with IMF and World Bank support <b>reduced debt, which fell from 76.2% of GDP in 2018 to 70.9% of GDP in 2019</b>.  The fiscal deficit stabilized at 1.2% of GDP in 2019, which is below the threshold set in the convergence criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/togo/publication/economic-update-for-togo-the-coronavirus-is-exerting-pressure-on-the-economy""><b>Growth prospects</b></a><b> will be severely undermined by the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 crisis.</b> The slowdown in global economic growth, coupled with the prevention measures for containing the virus contagion, could reduce production, domestic consumption, and exports. Revenues could plummet, whereas additional expenditures are essential to a robust health and economic response and the protection of businesses and households hardest hit by the crisis.  </p>

<p>Turkey's economic and social development performance since 2000 has been impressive, leading to increased employment and incomes and making Turkey an upper-middle-income country. However, in the past few years, growing economic vulnerabilities and a more challenging external environment have threatened to undermine those achievements.</p>
<p>For most of the period since 2000, Turkey maintained a long-term focus on implementing ambitious reforms in many areas, and government programs have targeted vulnerable groups and disadvantaged regions. Poverty incidence more than halved over 2002–15, and extreme poverty fell even faster.</p>
<p>During this time, Turkey urbanized dramatically, maintained strong macroeconomic and fiscal policy frameworks, opened to foreign trade and finance, harmonized many laws and regulations with European Union (EU) standards, and greatly expanded access to public services. It also recovered well from the global crisis of 2008/09.</p>
<p>Turkey's response to the influx of approximately 3.6 million Syrian refugees has been exemplary and provides a model to other countries hosting refugees.</p>
<p>However, there has been a slow-down in reforms in several areas in recent years that, together with economic vulnerabilities, risks reversing some of the progress made to date.</p>
<p>The overall macroeconomic picture is more vulnerable and uncertain, given rising inflation and unemployment, contracting investment, elevated corporate and financial sector vulnerabilities, and patchy implementation of corrective policy actions and reforms. There are also significant external headwinds due to ongoing geopolitical tensions in the subregion.  The impact of the COVID-19 crisis is expected to have a severely negative effect in Turkey, further weakening economic and social gains.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan is located at the center of the Eurasian continent and has been classified as an upper-middle-income country since 2012. It borders Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and, to the west of the country, the Caspian Sea, which offers abundant natural resources of gas and oil deposits.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan's gas reserves are estimated to be the world's fourth largest, representing about 10 percent of global reserves. In addition to cotton and natural gas, the country is rich in petroleum, sulfur, iodine, salt, bentonite clays, limestone, gypsum, and cement—all potential inputs to chemical and construction industries.</p>
<p>Although in July 2019 Turkmenistan signed a five-year contract with the Russian Federation to supply natural gas, the resumed volumes will be significantly lower than three years ago, making China the largest market for Turkmenistan's hydrocarbon exports. Additionally, the country is in the process of constructing the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline. Gas exports to other regions through gas swap mechanisms would help diminish the risk of overreliance on a single client.</p>
<p>Tight administrative controls and the public sector's dominant role in economic activity have hindered private sector development. Despite the growth of the private sector's share in segments of the economy, public sector and state-owned monopolies continue to govern the economy and the formal labor market. Apart from the hydrocarbon sector, foreign direct investment (FDI) remains limited.</p>
<p>Opening the economy, improving the business regulatory environment, accelerating the corporatization and privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and investing more heavily in human capital would be vital to boosting private sector development and achieving medium- and long-term national development goals.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 crisis has almost entirely extinguished GDP growth in 2020. To mitigate the economic, social, and health consequences of the pandemic, the Government has been taking anti-crisis policy measures. </p>
<p>These measures have focused on containing the virus, protecting lives and livelihoods, and keeping the reforms on track. Government efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic include sizable additional spending on health care and social assistance and financial support to firms. International financial support, including from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, and bilateral donors, is expected to cover the financing needs stemming from the crisis.</p>
<p>The relevant state agencies are currently drafting Poverty Reduction and Employment Strategies that will define further measures the Government will take until 2030 to protect the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Persistent COVID-19 disruptions at the local and international levels have tempered prospects for a quick recovery in 2021. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan's outlook remains positive as reforms continue to shift the economy toward greater resource efficiency and private sector growth.</p>

        <p>Chile has been one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies in recent decades thanks to a solid macroeconomic framework, which enabled the country to cushion the effects of a volatile international context and reduce the population living in poverty (on US$ 5.5 per day) from 30 percent in 2000 to 3.7 percent in 2017. However, more than 30% of the population is economically vulnerable and income inequality remains high.</p>
<p>In the context of social unrest, GDP growth decreased from 3.9 percent in 2018 to 1.1 percent in 2019. The disruptions in economic activity resulted in an uptick of unemployment, from 7.1 in December 2018 to 7.4 percent in December 2019. Social unrest caused a change in the composition of public spending away from an investment promotion agenda and towards higher social expenditures. It also induced the government to call for a constitutional referendum currently scheduled for October 25, 2020.</p>
<p>The current account deficit increased from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2018 to 3.9 percent in 2019 as lower exports more than offset a decline in imports caused by slowing domestic demand. As foreign investment dropped, the external deficit was financed by private and public external debt, which increased from 62 percent of GDP in 2018 to 70 percent in 2019. Over this period, international reserves increased slightly from US$39.8 to US$40.7 billion despite Central Bank interventions to prevent a higher nominal depreciation.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit increased from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2018 to 2.7 percent in 2019 due to additional spending in response to the civil unrest and the economic slowdown, dampened tax revenues and lower copper exports on revenues. The deficit was partially financed with fiscal buffers, but public debt increased from 26 to 28 percent, mainly domestic debt.</p>
<p>The social unrest reflected widely spread frustration with high and persistent inequality of opportunities that prevailed despite significant improvements in social outcomes. Between 2006 and 2017, Chile had reduced poverty (measured as income below US$5.5 2011 international dollars per day) from 19.6 to 3.7 percent, and the vulnerable population (income between US$5.5 and US$13 per day) decreased from 43.9 to 30.1 percent. However, inequality of incomes, as measured by the Gini coefficient, remained around 0.44 in 2017, among the highest in the region. The growing middle class perceives high inequality of opportunities due to segmented service provision in education and health care and segregated labor markets. Jobs and higher wage premiums have largely gone to skilled workers, while workers with fixed-term contracts support a greater workload, have less job security, and have not been traditionally entitled to severance pay or unemployment insurance, though some of this has been addressed in economic measure to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>The balance of risks is tilted to the downside due to uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 and the fluid domestic political context. Chile is exposed to lower than expected copper prices and longer subdued export demand resulting from the pandemic. Additionally, prolonged containment measures will likely impact on economic activity despite fiscal and monetary stimulus. Similarly, political uncertainty around the constitutional reform could weaken private sector confidence, dampening the recovery.</p>
<p>In the medium term, Chile needs to reach political consensus on a policy response to social demands, while not eroding Chile's traditionally sound macroeconomic management. Chile also should promote productivity gains at the bottom of the income distribution, including by fostering innovation, enhancing</p>
<p>the link between education and the labor market, and promoting female labor participation. Reducing inequality of opportunity will be crucial to eliminate the persistent pockets of poverty and ensure social stability.</p>

        <p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p>
<p>Since the 2000s, India has made remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty. Poverty levels are estimated to have declined from 21.6 percent in 2011 to 13.4 percent in 2015 (at the international poverty line), lifting more than 90 million people out of extreme poverty. In recent years it has undertaken important reforms to spur economic growth - introducing the bankruptcy code, implementation of the GST to integrate the national market and undertook a series of reforms to ease the conduct of business.</p>
<p>Growth was, however, already slowing when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. This was mostly due to a combination of domestic issues - including impaired balance sheets in the banking and corporate sectors and weak growth in rural incomes – as well as the slowdown in global trade.</p>
<p>After March 25, when a national lockdown, forced by the onset of Covid - 19, was implemented and several states imposed additional curfew measures, economic activity - particularly industry and services - slowed sharply. Real GDP contracted by an unprecedented 23.9 percent (year-on-year) in Q1 FY21.</p>
<p>The response of the Government of India to the COVID-19 outbreak has been swift and comprehensive. The government implemented a national lockdown to contain the health emergency. This was followed by a comprehensive policy package to mitigate the impact on the poorest through various social protection measures as well as liquidity and financial support for small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>The impact of pandemic, however, as in most large countries continues to be severe. The informal sector, where the vast majority of India's labor force is employed, has been particularly affected. Half of India's population already live precariously close to the poverty line and any income and job losses will increase their risk of slipping back into poverty. The pandemic has also exacerbated the vulnerabilities for traditionally excluded groups, such as youth and women.</p>
<p>Recognizing these challenges, India is reworking its social protection architecture to protect its workers, particularly informal sector workers, hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Until now, 70 percent of its vast social protection programs focused on the rural poor.  Internal migrants who crossed state borders to work were not covered. The country is now pivoting from a social protection program with a primarily rural focus into an integrated pan-India system that encompasses the informal sector and the urban poor.</p>
<p>The Indian Government has also announced range of other initiatives including – MSME incentives, infrastructure sector boost, Agriculture infrastructure, micro food enterprises, increased public employment outlay, special liquidity window, etc.</p>
<p>To build back better, it will be essential for India to continue to keep a strong focus on reducing inequality, as it seeks to implement growth oriented reforms to get the economy back on track. The World Bank is partnering with the government in this effort by helping strengthen policies, institutions, and investments to create a better future for the country and its people. </p>
<p><b>Economic Outlook</b></p>
<p>Before the pandemic, the economy was already decelerating. Real GDP growth had moderated from an average of 7.4 percent in FY16/19 to 4.2 percent in FY19/20  due to long-standing structural rigidities in key input markets; continuing balance sheet stress in the banking and corporate sector, compounded more recently by stress in the non-banking segment of the financial sector; increased risk aversion among banks and corporates; a decline in rural demand; and a subdued global economy. Although the government initiated several policy actions to arrest the slowdown, the pandemic accentuated the down turn and real GDP contracted by an unprecedented 23.9 percent (year-on-year) in Q1 FY21.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year starting in April 2020, India's economy is expected to contract by 9.6 percent, and recover only very gradually thereafter, with risks tilted on the downside. Weak activity, domestically and abroad, is also likely to depress both Indian imports and exports. </p>
<p>The significant fiscal and other policy responses announced by both the federal and state governments are expected to provide some relief, mostly to avoid an even deeper contraction. But, a potential source of risk to this effort stems from preexisting financial sector weaknesses and high levels of NPLs, which have been amplified by the crisis. </p>

        <p>Jordan has done well at minimizing the health impact of the COVID‐19 crisis. Soon after the outbreak, the Government of Jordan announced a first set of measures and incentives to address immediate liquidity and cost of financing concerns for various sectors/businesses, and measures to protect vulnerable households. Nevertheless, domestic lockdowns, the global economic slowdown, trade disruptions, and the suspension of international travel are likely to have a sizable impact on the Jordanian economy. The unprecedented economic shock of COVID-19 has exacerbated existing structural weaknesses in the economy and unresolved social challenges and put pressure on country's fragile macroeconomic stance. </p>
<p>Key challenges to Jordan's outlook include the prolonged decline in economic activity from domestic lockdowns, which could escalate high unemployment levels. The speed of economic recovery in the medium-term largely depends on the evolution of the pandemic and whether reforms are put into effect.</p>
<p>These reforms are anchored in the Five-Year Reform Matrix that Jordan developed in collaboration with the World Bank and other development partners. The Matrix lays the foundations for sustainable, inclusive growth that can deliver on agendas involving jobs, youth, and gender. These medium-term reforms aim to make Jordan's economy more efficient and reorient it toward export-led growth by creating a better business and investment environment. During the pandemic, reforms to support productivity and strengthen digitalization for the economy have been particularly useful.</p>
<p><b>Economic performance</b></p>
<p>Jordan's economic growth slowed to 1.3% in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting only partially the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Timid growth during the quarter resulted from an improvement in net exports and the marginal contribution of government consumption, while overall economic activity remained constrained by weak private demand and muted government investments. Meanwhile, labor market indicators for the second quarter of 2020 reflect the significant disruptions of the COVID-19 crisis. The already elevated unemployment rate has risen to 23% in Q2-2020 compared to 19.3% in Q1-2020, while the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.4% during this period. Looking ahead, the pandemic will have as disruptive an impact on the Jordanian economy and its prospects as it is having on Jordan's trading partners and the MENA region as a whole; its gradual recovery over the medium-term could capitalize on lower oil prices and a steady momentum for reform to increase efficiency and boost productivity.</p>
<p>At the fiscal level, the pandemic is exacerbating the fiscal deficit, as revenue collection has subsided given the economic slowdown and domestic lockdown measures. Although the government has created savings— by curtailing the public sector wage bill—pandemic-related spending pressures and recurrent spending rigidities are limiting Jordan's ability to confine the deficit. As a result, the overall central government's fiscal deficit (including grants and the use of cash) widened to 4% of GDP during the first five months of 2020, almost twice as high as during the same period in 2019. The sharp deterioration in government finances, together with the slowdown in economic growth, has elevated levels of public debt in central government (including debt holdings of the Social Security Investment Fund) to 105.3% of forecasted GDP at end-May 2020. In the medium-term, the fiscal stance is expected to improve once economic activity gradually recovers.</p>
<p>As for the external sector, the current account deficit (including grants) narrowed by 6.3% year-on-year during Q1-2020. For Q2-2020, an initial build-up of external sector pressure was alleviated: exports and imports returned to positive growth in June following contractions in April and May 2020. Remittance inflows, on the other hand, remained negative throughout the second quarter, while the suspension of commercial flights prevented any inflows of travel receipts. Although the decline in international oil prices will support a lower import bill, the current account deficit is expected to widen significantly in 2020 due to subdued external demand and its spillover effects on the domestic economy through a decline in exports, remittances, travel, and foreign investments. </p>

        <p><b>Political and Security Update</b></p>
<p>The administration of President George M. Weah will clock two years in office in January 2020 and will be taking stock of its deliverables in terms of social services and fulfilling campaign promises to the people of Liberia and what to achieve for the remaining four years. The government put into place its Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) at the latter part of the first year. The PAPD is guided by four pillars focusing on empowering Liberians through education, health, youth development and social protection, enabling private sector-led economic growth, supporting a peaceful society, and creating an inclusive and accountable public sector.</p>
<p>During the period under review, the country's economy was challenged with rising inflation as a result of significant depreciation of the Liberian dollar against the United States dollar and other factors. This hampered the Government's ability to fully deliver services and meet other obligations. Consequently, the Government is working with its development partners to help it tackle the economic glitches, while instituting measures to promote growth and development, critical for sustaining peace and stability.</p>
<p>Following the highly contested 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections that ushered in the George Weah-led administration into office, Liberia is bracing itself for the Senatorial Mid-Term Elections in 2020. The tenure of 15 out of 30 senators will be expiring and those seeking re-election will have to face the electorates. The Legislature has passed a bill for a national referendum to reduce the tenure of the President and members of the House of Representatives from six to five years and senators from nine to seven years. Dual citizenship is also included for the referendum.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p><b>Liberia's economy is projected to contract by 1.4% in 2019, following the modest growth of 1.2% in 2018</b>. Inflation reached 31.3% by August 2019, up from 26.1% the previous year. The non-mining sector is expected to contract by 3.4 per-cent in 2019, on the back of contraction in services and manufacturing and weak performance in agriculture, while mining sector is expected to grow by 7.8% due to increased production of gold and ore.</p>
<p><b>The overall fiscal deficit of the central government widened from 4.1% of GDP in FY2017 to 4.8% of GDP in FY2018 and further to an estimated 6.2% in FY2019, reflecting low domestic revenue mobilization and high public spending</b>. Tax revenues accounted for 12.1% of GDP in FY2019, which is low by regional standards. The wage bill increased to 10.1% of GDP or over two-thirds of total expenditures in FY2019, crowding out other recurrent expenditures, particularly the provision of goods and services in the social sectors and infrastructure spending. The larger fiscal deficit led to a rapid increase in public debt from 40.2% of GDP in FY2018 to 54.5% of GDP in FY2019.The Government is currently implementing wage bill reforms intended to reduce the size of the wage bill, going forward.</p>
<p><b>Liberia's current account deficit narrowed to 21.1% in 2019 from 23.4% of GDP in 2018. This was largely due to a decline in imports following the complete UNMIL drawdown, while exports of gold and iron ore rose</b>. However, these improvements were offset by a fall in net income and decline in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and donor transfers, and consequently gross official reserves declined from USD 333 million (2.5 months of import coverage) at end- 2018 to an estimated $280 million (2.1 months of import coverage) at end-2019.</p>
<p><b>Liberia's medium-term growth prospects are expected to improve as macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms get implemented</b>. Following the expected contraction in 2019, GDP growth is projected to recover to 1.4% in 2020 and further to 3.4% in 2021, driven by the recovery in the non-mining sector and a moderate expansion in the mining sector. </p>

        <p>The Philippines is one of the most dynamic economies in the East Asia Pacific region. With increasing urbanization, a growing middle class, and a large and young population, the Philippines' economic dynamism is rooted in strong consumer demand supported by a vibrant labor market and robust remittances. Business activities are buoyant with notable performance in the services sector including the business process outsourcing, real estate, and finance and insurance industries.</p>
<p>Sound economic fundamentals and a globally recognized competitive workforce reinforce the growth momentum. Having sustained average annual growth of 6.4% between 2010-2019 from an average of 4.5% between 2000-2009, the country is on its way from a lower middle-income country with a gross national income per capita of US$3,850 in 2019 to an upper middle-income country (per capita income range of US$4,046–$12,535) in the near term.</p>
<p>Real economic growth, however, has been challenged by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak and the strict community quarantine measures imposed in the country.  Growth is now projected to contract in 2020, driven by significant declines in consumption and investment growth, and exacerbated by the sharp slowdown in exports, tourism, and remittances.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, economic growth is expected to rebound gradually in 2021-2022 assuming a containment of the virus domestically and globally, and with more robust domestic activity bolstered by greater consumer and business confidence and the public investment momentum.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Philippine economy has made progress in delivering inclusive growth, evidenced by a decline in poverty rates and its Gini coefficient. Poverty declined from 23.3% in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018 while the Gini coefficient declined from 44.9 to 42.7 over the same period. The ongoing increasing trend in real wages, which is expected to have a positive impact on household incomes—particularly those from the lower income groups—will be hampered by the impact of the COVID-19, with negative consequences also for poverty reduction in the Philippines.</p>

        <p>Singapore is a high-income economy with a gross national income of US$54,530 per capita, as of 2017. The country provides one of the world's <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/singapore"">most business-friendly regulatory environment</a> for local entrepreneurs and is ranked among the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018"">world's most competitive economies</a>.</p>
<p>In the decades after independence, Singapore rapidly developed from a low-income country to a high-income country. GDP growth in the city-state has been amongst the world's highest, at an average of 7.7% since independence and topping 9.2% in the first 25 years.</p>
<p>After rapid industrialization in the 1960s catapulted the island nation's development trajectory, manufacturing became the main driver of growth. In the early 1970s, Singapore reached full employment and joined the ranks of Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan a decade later as Asia's newly industrializing economies. The manufacturing and services sectors remain the twin pillars of Singapore's high value-added economy.</p>
<p>The overall growth of the Singapore economy was 3.2% in 2018. Value-added manufacturing, particularly in the electronics and precision engineering sectors, remain key drivers of growth, as are the services sector, particularly the information and communications industries, which grew 6.0% year-on-year, and the finance &amp; insurance industries, which grew 5.9% year-on-year.  Economic growth is expected to moderate in 2019, with the government forecasting a range of 1.5% to 3.5%, projecting the rate to be slightly below the middle of the forecast range.</p>
<p>In 2017, Singapore launched the regional finance hub <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://sbr.com.sg/building-engineering/news/singapore-working-become-%E2%80%98asias-infrastructure-exchange"">‘Asia's Infrastructure Exchange'</a>: “the go-to place where infrastructure demand and supply can connect, where infrastructure expertise and financing can be obtained and infrastructure needs are met.” In its announcement, the government highlighted the country's strong ecosystem, one that integrates infrastructure players along the whole value chain – multilateral banks, private financiers, lawyers, accountants, engineers and other professional services.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">World Bank Human Capital Index</a>, Singapore ranks the best country in the world in human capital development. This means that a child born today in Singapore will be 88% as productive when she grows up, as if she enjoyed complete education and full health. Together with strong financial support from the government, the country continues to strengthen the nimbleness and flexibility of its workforce by providing continuing education such as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.skillsfuture.sg/""><i>Skillsfuture</i></a> initiative. Government spending on continuing education will nearly double, to more than S$1 billion yearly. </p>

        <p><i>Last updated September 2020</i></p>
<p>Over the last four decades, Thailand has made remarkable progress in social and economic development, moving from a low-income to an upper-income country in less than a generation. As such, Thailand has been a widely cited development success story, with sustained strong growth and impressive poverty reduction. While Thailand has been successful in stemming the tide of COVID-19 (coronavirus) infections over the last few months, the economic impact has been severe and has led already to widespread job losses, affecting middle-class households and the poor alike and threatening hard-won gains in poverty reduction</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/thailand-economic-monitor-june-2020-thailand-in-the-time-of-covid-19"">Economic growth in Thailand</a> is expected to contract in 2020 , which is among the sharpest projected declines in the East Asia and Pacific region, due to a decline in external demand affecting trade and tourism, supply chain disruptions and weakening domestic consumption. The outbreak will likely lead to severe job losses, particularly in tourism, due to transmission control and social distancing measures. The impact on household welfare is also likely to be severe. The number of economically insecure, i.e., those living below $5.5 per day, is projected to double from 4.7 million in Q1 2020 to an estimated 9.7 million in Q2 2020, before recovering slightly to 7.8 million in Q3 2020. The government has quickly responded with a fiscal package (6% of GDP), unprecedented in terms of size and range of instruments, aimed at supporting vulnerable households and firms. The World Bank stands ready to support the government's COVID-19 recovery program with the full breadth of our instruments.</p>
<p>In recent years, economic growth slowed from 4.2% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2019. The key drivers of slowing growth were weaker demand for exports reflecting the impact of US-China trade tensions, slowing public investments, and a drought, impacting agricultural production. Key development challenges also pose a risk to Thailand's future growth if it wants to attain high-income status by 2037. These include weakness in education outcomes and skills matching, which risk future productivity and chances of the younger generation, and increasing spatial inequality, with remote areas falling behind in economic and welfare indicators.</p>
<p>Poverty declined substantially over the last 30 years from 65.2% in 1988 to 9.85% in 2018 (based on official national estimates). However, the growth of household incomes and consumption growth both have stalled nationwide in recent years. This resulted in a <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/thailand/publication/taking-the-pulse-of-poverty-and-inequality-in-thailand"">reversal in the progress of poverty reduction in Thailand</a> with the number of people living in poverty rising.  Between 2015 and 2018, the poverty rate in Thailand increased from 7.2% to 9.8%, and the absolute number of people living in poverty rose from 4.85 million to more than 6.7 million. The increase in poverty in 2018 was widespread - occurring in all regions and in 61 out of 77 provinces. In the Central and Northeast, the number of the poor increased by over half a million in each region during the same period. The conflict-affected South became the region with the highest poverty rate for the first time in 2017.</p>
<p>Inequality – as measured by the Gini coefficient – increased between 2015 and 2017. During this period, average household consumption per capita grew, but the household consumption of the bottom 40% of the population shrank.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank Human Capital Index, which measures the productivity level for the next generation of workers relative to their full potential if all education and health outcomes were maximized, uneven education quality is a big challenge for Thailand. A Thai child born today can expect to obtain 12.7 years of schooling before the age of 18. However, once adjusted for quality of learning, that only amounts to 8.7 years of schooling, indicating a gap of 3 years.</p>
<p>Thailand's adult survival rate between ages 15-60 is lower than over half of the countries where such data is available. Over the past 15 years, Thailand's prevalence of diabetes and hypertension have tripled and quadrupled, respectively, and combined with high rates of road injuries, has negatively affected adult survival rate. Only 87% of 15-year-olds are expected to live past age 60.</p>

        <p>Uruguay stands out in Latin America for being an egalitarian society and for its high income per capita, low level of inequality and poverty and the almost complete absence of extreme poverty. In relative terms, its middle class is the largest in America, and represents more than 60% of its population. Uruguay is positioned among the first places in the region in relation to various well-being indices, such as the Human Development Index, the Human Opportunity Index and the Economic Freedom Index. Institutional stability and low levels of corruption are reflected in the high level of public trust in government. According to the Human Opportunity Index constructed by the World Bank, Uruguay has managed to attain a high level of equal opportunities in terms of access to basic services such as education, running water, electricity and sanitation.</p>
<p>In July 2013, the World Bank classified Uruguay as a high-income country. By 2017, the Gross National Income per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) amounted to US$21,870.</p>
<p>Since 2003, the Uruguayan economy has had positive economic growth rates, averaging 4,1% from 2003 to 2018. Uruguay's economic growth has remained positive even in 2017 and 2018, in spite of recessions experienced by Argentina and Brazil, thus departing from previous patterns when growth was synchronized with that of its main neighbors. Prudent macroeconomic policies and a commitment to diversify its markets and products within the dominant agriculture and forestry sectors have increased the country's ability to withstand regional shocks.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the dependency on its main trading partners, Uruguay diversified its export markets. In 2018, Brazil and Argentina, Uruguay's traditional trading partners, only represented 12% and 5% respectively of the total merchandise exports. Nowadays, its main trading partners are China (26%) and the European Union (18%).</p>
<p>Two main characteristics —a solid social contract and economic openness— paved the way to poverty reduction and the promotion of shared prosperity that Uruguay successfully followed in the last decade.</p>
<p>According to official measures, moderate poverty went from 32.5% in 2006 to 8.1% in 2018, while extreme poverty has practically disappeared: it went down from 2.5% to 0.1% in the same period. In terms of equity, income levels among the poorest 40% of the Uruguayan population increased much faster than the average growth rate of income levels of the entire population. Nonetheless, there are significant differences: the proportion of the population below the (national) poverty line is still significantly higher in the North of the country; among children and youth (17.2% among children younger than 6, and 15% and 13.9% among the age groups 6 to 12 and 13 to 17, respectively); and, among the afro descendant population (17.4%).</p>
<p>Inclusive social policies have focused on expanding program coverage; according to the World Bank, around 87% of the population aged 65 or more is covered by the pension system. This is one of the highest coefficients in Latin America and the Caribbean alongside Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<p>The strong macroeconomic performance was also reflected in the labor market, with a historically low unemployment rate recorded in 2011 (6.3%). However, given the noticeable slowdown in economic growth, the unemployment rate increased to 7.9% in 2018.</p>
<p>Despite recent progress in Uruguay, several structural constraints to growth remain, in particular in the areas of infrastructure investment, integration into global value chains and education/skills performance, which may obstruct the progress towards sustainable development outcomes. The strong institutional performance in other areas, such as public trust in government, low corruption and a consensus-based political approach, together with a deep commitment to strengthening its institutional set-up, give the country a solid basis from which to continue renewing its social contract and put in place policies to address such constraints.</p>
<p>Uruguay maintains an adequate macroeconomic framework but in a much more complicated external environment.</p>

<p> <div class=""c14v1-body c14v1-body-text flipboard-keep "">
        
        <p>Bordered by Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria, Benin has a 121-kilometer-long coastline on the Gulf of Guinea, a population of close to 11.53 million (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/country/benin?view=chart"">201</a>8), and an average life expectancy of 61.2 years.  Benin's economy is heavily reliant on the informal re-export and transit trade with Nigeria (estimated at approximately 20% of GDP), and on agriculture, especially cotton, which is the country's leading export product.</p>
<p>Despite steady, robust economic growth over the past two decades, poverty remains widespread owing to limited growth in per capita terms (only 1.5% on average during the period 2008–2018). The national headcount poverty rate was estimated at 40.1% in 2015 as against 49.5% in 2008 (based on the international poverty threshold set at S$1.90 per person per day in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms).</p>
<p>Greater economic diversification, more efficient public spending, and a more equitable geographical distribution of resources would pave the way for lower poverty rates and more inclusive growth.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Benin is a stable democracy, despite some tension surrounding the legislative elections held on April 28, 2019. The most recent presidential elections held in March 2016 were won by the multi-millionaire cotton tycoon, Patrice Talon. The government currently enjoys an absolute majority in Parliament (83 deputies). In accordance with the party system reform approved by the National Assembly in 2018, several political parties and movements were merged to comply with the new Charter of political parties. Benin now has around a dozen State-recognized parties compared to over 200 parties prior to the reform. The next commune-level and local elections are expected to be held in May 2020.</p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The short-term outlook is negative due to the <b>global economic slowdown associated with COVID-19</b>. External transmission channels will play a significant role, particularly the slowdown in the Nigerian economy in the wake of low oil prices and the overall drop in raw material prices, especially cotton. Based on estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investors have already withdrawn S$83 billion from emerging markets since the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Capital outflows are likely to lead to a sharp drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) and to increased financing costs. The impact of internal transmission channels – reduction in consumption and domestic investment – will depend on contagion risk and the public policy choices made to combat the pandemic.</li>
<li>Before the spread of the coronavirus, a crisis that will have a negative impact on economic activity and government revenue, Benin had recorded solid economic outcomes between 2016 and 2019, with <b>average real GDP growth of 5.5%</b>. But the decision taken by Nigeria, Benin's main economic partner, to unilaterally close its land borders with its neighbors in August 2019 has dealt a major blow to economic activity in Benin. Indeed, despite the country's relative resilience, economic activity slowed to <b>6.4% in 2019</b> from 6.7% in 2018 (representing per capita GDP growth of 3.5%).</li>
<li>On the supply side, <b>growth was driven by agriculture</b>, thanks to extensive cotton production (+18%) in the first half of the year. Industry and services also contributed positively to growth, thanks to the increase in locally-generated electricity following the opening of a new power station. On the demand side, consumer spending and private investment were the major contributors to economic activity. <b>Inflation remained moderate at -0.9% in 2019</b> owing to heightened agricultural output despite the rise in fuel prices.</li>
<li>The fiscal deficit (grants included) fell considerably from 2.9% to 0.5% of GDP between 2018 and 2019, driven by the limited execution of externally financed projects that led in turn to a reduction in investment spending, while domestic and non-tax revenue flows compensated in part for the shortfall in customs revenue caused by the closure of the border. The <b>debt-to-GDP ratio was stabilized, moving from 41.5% in 2018 to 41.6% in 2019</b>. The overall risk of debt distress remains moderate.</li>
<li>The external current account deficit (including grants) widened from -4.6% of GDP in 2018 to -5.1% of GDP in 2019, driven by the <b>drop in cotton prices and the increase in imports of construction inputs and energy products</b>.  The key export products were cotton and cashew nuts, while energy products, machinery and construction material made up the bulk of imports.</li>
<li>Like the eight countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Benin's monetary policy is managed by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which keeps the CFA franc pegged to the euro. <b>The BCEAO's foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to 4.9 months of imports in 2019, against 4.5 months in 2018</b>, owing primarily to community-wide fiscal consolidation and net capital inflows. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by 5% in 2019, driven by the nominal depreciation of the euro against the US dollar and the persistently lower inflation rate of WAEMU in relation to its trading partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>The business environment improved in the formal sector but remains weak. Benin occupies position 76 on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://lpi.worldbank.org/international/scorecard/radar/254/C/BEN/2018#chartarea"">Logistics Performance Index</a> and ranks 149 out of 190 countries in the World Bank's <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/benin"">Doing Business</a> report on business regulation. Benin has recently made progress in “starting a business” and “getting electricity,” but must, however, do more in the areas of “getting credit.”  Moreover, despite the strides made, Benin continues to grapple with major corruption-related challenges, ranking 85 out of 180 countries on <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018"">Transparency International's</a> Corruption Perceptions Index for 2018, with a score of 40/100.</p>

Since 1945, Canada and the World Bank Group have worked together, with other member governments, to finance projects, design policies, and deliver programs to end poverty and create a world based on the principles of sustainable development.</p>
<p>The World Bank Group benefits from having among its leading members a country that has long been a strong proponent of multilateralism. Enshrining that concept as the foundation of the international order has been a hallmark of Canada's foreign policy since the end of World War II.<b></b></p>
<p>For Canada, membership in the world's premier multilateral development financing institution enables it to leverage not only its funds, but also its knowledge and capabilities for greater impact on poverty reduction and sustainable development worldwide. For its part, the World Bank Group recognizes Canada not only as a significant financial contributor but also as a steadfast partner in the effort to achieve its goals, which today are aimed squarely at targeting poverty reduction in the developing world.</p>
<p>Canada is a founding member of the World Bank and plays an important role in influencing its development priorities. Over 60% of Canada's official development assistance to international financial institutions goes to the World Bank Group.</p>

        <p>In many aspects, Costa Rica is a success story in terms of development. It is considered an upper middle-income country, which has shown a steady economic growth over the past 25 years. This growth resulted from an outward- oriented strategy, based on the openness to foreign investment and gradual trade liberalization.</p>
<p>Costa Rica is also a global leader for its environmental policies and accomplishments, which have helped the country build its Green Trademark. The pioneering Payments for Environmental Services (PES) program has been successful in promoting forest and biodiversity conservation; making Costa Rica the only tropical country in the world that has reversed deforestation.</p>
<p>The combination of political stability, social contract and steady growth has resulted in one of the lowest poverty rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the proportion of the population with incomes below US$ 5.5 per person per day decreased slightly from 12.9 to 10.7 percent between 2010 and 2016.</p>
<p>The success of the country in recent decades is also reflected in its strong indicators of human development, which have contributed to move the country up the global ranks, higher than the other countries in the region.</p>
<p>While these achievements are celebrated, the country needs to focus on maintaining the steady growth, and in continuing poverty reduction amid the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic which has hit hard Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The country now faces the risk of a sudden interruption in capital flows. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to fall in 2020 to -5.4 percent. Poverty and unemployment are expected to increase, partly due to the impact of the health emergency on tourism and trade, plus a contraction in areas such as agriculture and construction. However, a rebound is expected by 2021 as restrictions are lifted and supported by accommodative monetary policy and reforms related to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) accession process, along with fiscal consolidation efforts.</p>
<p>Two pressing development challenges stand out: the fiscal situation and persistent inequality. These challenges affect the basic pillars of the Costa Rican development model: inclusion, growth, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The government has strived to address these problems and is committed to an inclusive society that guarantees the welfare of its people, supported by transparent and accountable public institutions.</p>

        <p>Côte d'Ivoire, Francophone West Africa's economic hub, is one of the world's fastest growing economies and remains the globe's leading producer and exporter of cocoa beans and cashew nuts.</p>
<p>Despite recent efforts, Côte d'Ivoire has a low <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">human capital index score (0.35)</a> according to World Bank rankings, and still has one of the highest<b> </b><a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/07/24/cote-divoire-policies-supporting-gender-parity-could-bring-6-8-billion-to-countrys-economy""><b>gender inequality rates</b></a><b> </b>in the world. The country should target the most vulnerable segments of the population for greater redistribution of the benefits reaped from its sound economic performance, further integrate women into the economy, and develop its human capital to better meet the needs of the labor market.  The production of modern goods and services requires skills that are still lacking in the local labor force.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Côte d'Ivoire is headed toward presidential elections slated for October 31, 2020 to select the successor to President Alassane Ouattara, who opted not to run again after serving two consecutive five-year terms. The two main opposition leaders, Henri Konan Bédié and former president Laurent Gbagbo, have not yet declared their intention to run for the presidency.</p>
<p>Laurent Gbagbo was acquitted by the International Criminal Court, but granted conditional release pending appeal proceedings. Upon completion of these proceedings, he could join the presidential race.</p>
<p>In addition, the constitution and electoral code were revised and adopted in late March 2020 by both houses of Parliament and enacted by President Ouattara. The opposition, which called for a referendum to amend the constitution, is still contesting the legitimacy of the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI), which has been tasked with organizing the upcoming elections. The <i>Parti Démocratique de Côte d'Ivoire</i> (PDCI) led by Henri Konan Bédié and the <i>Front Populaire Ivoirien</i> (FPI) headed by Laurent Gbagbo, as well as parties close to the former speaker of the National Assembly, Guillaume Soro, did not participate in the discussions that led to the setting up of the CEI.</p>
<p>This disagreement, as well as disputes surrounding the issuance of new ID cards that will also serve as voter cards for the first time in the country, are raising fears of renewed political tensions as presidential elections approach.</p>
<p><b>Economic Situation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the <b>global shock triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, </b> Côte d'Ivoire still had one of the most robust growth rates in Africa and in the world. The economy, which had grown at an average annual rate of 8% since 2012, had been projected to grow by 7% in 2020. However, the global health situation has had a major impact on Ivorian households and businesses, and economic <b>growth for 2020—originally projected to be 7%—</b><a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/cotedivoire/publication/the-state-of-the-ivorian-economy-how-cote-divoire-could-rebound-after-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-boost-growth""><b>is now expected</b></a><b> to slow to around 1.8%</b>.</li>
<li>While the <b>construction sector</b> was one of the main drivers of growth in 2019, the gradual diversification of the economy and the vibrant private sector are expected to fuel growth in 2020.</li>
<li>The proximity of the presidential elections, which are scheduled for October 2020, and the health crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic may create uncertainty and have a <b>negative impact on private investment</b>.  </li>

        <p>Eswatini is a landlocked country in Southern Africa bordering South Africa and Mozambique, with a population of 1.2 million. Poverty levels have stagnated at high levels in the last five years, with 39.7% of the population estimated to have been living under the international $1.90 poverty line in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>Eswatini has close economic linkages to South Africa, which it depends on for about 85% of its imports and about 60% of exports. Eswatini is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), with Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa. Under the CMA, the Eswatini lilangeni (the domestic currency) is pegged at par to the South African rand, which is also legal tender in the country.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2018 is estimated at 2.4% from 2% in 2017, partly driven by a stronger-than-projected recovery in the primary and service sectors. However, due to escalating fiscal challenges (reflected through accumulation of domestic arrears) that are expected to continue slowing recovery in construction and public administration sectors, real GDP for 2019 is projected to decline to 1.3%.</p>
<p>Wage costs have remained elevated as the fiscal situation continues to deteriorate. As a result, the fiscal deficit increased from about 5% of GDP in 2017 to 7% in 2018. It is projected to remain negative in the medium-term.<a name=""_Hlk20936670"" id=""_Hlk20936670""></a> Consequently, public debt has rapidly increased, rising from 10% of GDP in 2009 to hit around 30% of GDP in July 2019.</p>
<p>The government also continues accumulating domestic arrears that increased from 3% of GDP in 2016 to 10.3% of GDP by July 2019. As a result, gross official reserves have been consistently below the three-month international benchmark, reaching a low of two months of imports of goods and services in March 2019.</p>
<p>For the first time, inflation remained below the 3% lower-band threshold from April to August 2019 as the government has kept the price of housing and utilities constant for more than 12 months. During the first eight months of 2019, inflation averaged 3% compared to 4.6% recorded during the same period last year. Due to decreasing inflation the Central Bank of Eswatini maintained an accommodative monetary policy for the same period and further cuts interest by 25 basis points to 6.5% in July 2019.</p>
<p><b>Development challenges</b></p>
<p>Poverty has persisted despite the country's lower-middle-income status. Nationally, 58.9% of Swazis lived below the national poverty line in 2017. This follows a decline from 63% in 2009, and 69.0% in 2001. By international poverty standards, 38.6% of Swazis lived below the 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) of $1.90 per person per day, and this rises to 60.4% when the 2011 PPP $3.20 per person per day poverty line for lower middle-income countries is used.</p>
<p>Challenges to poverty reduction include slowing economic growth, adverse weather patterns, high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, high unemployment, and high inequality; the per adult equivalent consumption Gini index stagnated around 49.0 between 2010 and 2017.</p>
<p>National elections were held in September 2018, which the Southern African Development Community and African Union Observer missions declared peaceful. A new cabinet was announced in November and the Strategic Roadmap serves as the guiding document to turn around the economy, improve services delivery and improve fiscal position. </p>

        <p>Ghana sits on the Atlantic Ocean and borders Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. It has a population of about 29.6 million (2018). In the past two decades, it has taken major strides toward democracy under a multi-party system, with its independent judiciary winning public trust. Ghana consistently ranks in the top three countries in Africa for freedom of speech and press freedom, with strong broadcast media, with radio being the medium with the greatest reach. Factors such as these provide Ghana with solid social capital.</p>
<p>Two and a half years after being elected president in a peaceful election, President Akuffo-Addo has marked some successes implementing some of its promises such as planting for food and jobs and free secondary education. But he also faces challenges fulfilling some of his election pledges—including setting up a factory in each of the nation's 216 districts, one dam for every village and providing free high school education.</p>
<p><b>Recent Economic Developments and Outlook</b></p>
<p><b>Recent Developments</b>. Ghana's economy continued to expand in 2019 as the first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth was estimated at 6.7%, compared with 5.4% in the same period of last year. Non-oil growth was also strong at 6.0%. The relatively high quarterly growth was driven by a strong recovery in the services sector which grew by 7.2% compared with 1.2% in 2018.</p>
<p><a name=""_Hlk18444175"" id=""_Hlk18444175""></a>The government continued with its fiscal consolidation efforts in 2019 even though there were still challenges in meeting the revenue targets<b>.</b> Fiscal performance for the first half of 2019 showed an overall budget deficit (on cash basis) of 3.3% of GDP higher than the target of 2.9% of GDP. This is because the revenue shortfalls of 1.6% of GDP was higher than expenditure cuts of 1% of GDP.</p>
<p>Private sector credit grew stronger, supported largely by the well-capitalized banking sector. Inflation continued to be in single digits in the first six months of 2019; gradually rising from 9% in January to 9.5% in April 2019 but reduced to 9.1% in June 2019 mainly driven by low food inflation.</p>
<p><a name=""_Hlk18444124"" id=""_Hlk18444124""></a>Ghana's current account in the first half of 2019 was estimated at a surplus of 0.1% of GDP supported by favorable trade conditions of Ghana's three main export commodities—oil, gold and cocoa, resulting in a trade surplus of 2.8% of GDP. The current account surplus, combined with significant inflows to the capital and financial accounts, resulted in an overall balance of payments surplus equivalent to 1.9% of GDP. With the issuance of the $3 billion Eurobond in March 2019, the international reserves significantly improved in 2019 with Gross International Reserves (GIR) of $8.6 billion (equivalent to 4.3 months of import cover) at the end of June 2019.</p>
<p><a name=""_Hlk18444344"" id=""_Hlk18444344""></a><a name=""_Hlk18444690"" id=""_Hlk18444690""></a>The Ghana cedi came under considerable pressure in the first quarter of 2019, due to high demand, as importers sought to restock their supplies but, in the second quarter, the domestic currency market became relatively calmer. The Ghana cedi cumulatively depreciated by 8.2% in the year to July 18, 2019.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Outlook:</b> Economic growth is projected to increase to 7.6% in 2019. Non-oil growth is expected to accelerate to 6% as the government's new policies in the agriculture sector and the promotion of agribusiness begin to take effect. Inflation is expected to remain within the Central Bank's target range of 6-10% over the medium term.</p>
<p>The pace of fiscal consolidation is expected to slow in 2019 and the overall fiscal deficit is projected at 4.5% of GDP in 2019 and, in the medium term, it will remain within fiscal rule ceiling of 5% of GDP.</p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges: </b>Maintaining a fiscal consolidation stance and staying on a sustainable path through the 2020 election cycle will be a challenge over the next two years.<b> </b>Also, Ghana's energy sector is in dire financial conditions and without remedy, this poses serious fiscal risks in the coming years. The sector is facing high costs from excess power capacity and natural gas supply, which are exacerbating the existing revenue gap. An Energy Sector Recovery Program (ESRP), approved in May 2019, provides an action plan to the government to bring the sector back into financial balance over the next five years.</p>

        <p>Guinea-Bissau, one of the world's poorest and most fragile countries, has a population of about <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.worldbank.org/country/guinea-bissau?view=chart"">1.9 million</a>. Guinea-Bissau's Atlantic Ocean coast is composed of an archipelago, the Bijagos, of more than 100 islands. It borders Senegal to the north and Guinea to the south and east, and despite its size, is host to a large variety of ethnic groups, languages, and religions.</p>
<p><b>Political Context</b></p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau has a history of political and institutional fragility dating back to its independence from Portugal in 1974. The country is one of the most coup-prone and politically unstable countries in the world. Since independence, four successful coups have been recorded in Guinea-Bissau, with another 16 coups attempted, plotted, or alleged.  Held in December 2019, the last Presidential elections were followed by a political crisis, as the defeated candidate, Domingos Simões Pereira, alleging existence of fraud and irregularities, filed a motion to challenge the election results which decision by the Supreme Court is still pending. In April 2020, ECOWAS, followed by the European Union, recognized the election of Umaro Sissoco Embalo as President of the Republic and called for the appointment of a new Prime Minister and government  based on the results of the legislative elections of March 10, 2019. Outcomes of these legislatives elections indicate a configuration of the political picture, with no absolute majority. However, after the Parliamentary session held on June 29, 2020 a new majority seems to be in place after the approval of the de <i>facto Government's</i> program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Economic Overview</b></p>
<p>·        Growth <b>reached 4.6%</b> (2.2%in per capita terms), from 3.8% in 2018. The recovery was supported by higher cashew output and higher electricity production due to newly installed power generation capacity. However, growth remained below the potential rate of 5% as pre-election political uncertainty weighed on economic activity. The negative output gap exerted a downward pressure on inflation, which remained low at 0.5%. The overall fiscal deficit increased from 4.8% of GDP in 2018 to 5% in 2019, mainly owing to higher recurrent spending. Tax revenue increased marginally from 8.8% of GDP in 2018 to 9.1% in 2019, due to the pickup in economic activity. However, this was largely offset by weaknesses in customs and non-tax revenue. On the expenditure side, total government spending increased from 19.5% of GDP in 2018 to 23% in 2019.</p>
<p>·        <b>Growth is projected to decline to -1.5%</b> (-3.8% in per capita terms) in 2020, as lockdown put in place since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic weighs on domestic demand and global cashew demand and price decline. Domestic consumption and investment would be severely affected by the lockdown. Higher public spending to support people and firms affected by the crisis, largely financed by external sources, would help prevent a sharper growth contraction. Inflation is projected to rise from 0.5% in 2019 to 1.1% in 2020, mainly reflecting pressures on food prices caused by negative global supply disruption effects and amplified by local supply shocks.</p>
<p>The outlook is subject to substantial downside risks. Renewed political instability could cause fiscal slippages and exacerbate the already difficult business environment. Substantially lower cashew prices or quantities exported would also pose a risk given the high export concentration in cashew. The persistence of the COVID-19 crisis could adversely affect household income and increases their risk of falling into poverty. Risks associated with banking instability also remain a threat to macro-financial stability.</p>
<p>A steep increase in oil prices would also put pressure on the external current account balance and leave less resources for pro-poor government spending. Addressing high inequality in the country also requires efforts to improve service delivery and enhance access to basic services. However, accelerating or even sustaining the pace of poverty reduction will be difficult if the political situation remains unresolved, and if the major development challenges that constrain growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability are not addressed.</p>

        <p>The largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia – a diverse archipelago nation of more than 300 ethnic groups – has charted impressive economic growth since overcoming the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Today, Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation, the world's 10th largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, and a member of the G-20. Furthermore, Indonesia has made enormous gains in poverty reduction, cutting the poverty rate by more than half since 1999, to 9.78% in 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, Indonesia was able to maintain a consistent economic growth, recently qualifying the country to reach the<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2020-2021""> upper middle income status</a>.</p>
<p>Indonesia's economic planning follows a 20-year development plan, spanning from 2005 to 2025. It is segmented into 5-year medium-term plans, called the RPJMN (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional) each with different development priorities. The current medium-term development plan – the last phase of the long-term plan – runs from 2020 to 2024. It aims to further strengthen Indonesia's economy by improving the country's human capital and competitiveness in the global market. Considerable challenges remain in achieving Indonesia's goals. On top of this, the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic brings unprecedented complications for Indonesia to achieve its development goals.  </p>
<p>Out of a population of around 270.2 million, about 26.42 million Indonesians still live below the poverty line. Without a significant expansion of social assistance, as many as 5.5-8 million Indonesians could have been pushed into poverty because of the COVID-19 shock.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Indonesia was able to reduce the stunting rate to 27.6% in 2017, more works remains to be done. Such effort is critical to ensure Indonesia's strong and productive human capital. At the moment, according to the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/human-capital"">World Bank's Human Capital Index</a>, Indonesia's next generation will only be 54% as productive as she or he could have been with full health and complete education.</p>
<p>To immediately respond to the COVID-19 crisis, the Government has announced a fiscal package amounting to 4.3 percent of GDP. The package includes funds to improve the preparedness of the health sector and a substantial increase in social assistance. The World Bank is supporting the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/05/29/the-world-bank-approves-financing-for-indonesias-covid-19-coronavirus-emergency-response"">Indonesia's COVID-19 emergency response</a>, including enhancing  social assistance and health care systems while also strengthening the resilience of the financial sector.</p>

<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p>Jamaica is the largest island in the English-speaking Caribbean, and the most populated with 2.93 million people. Like its neighbors, Jamaica is vulnerable to natural disasters - such as hurricanes and flooding - and the effects of climate change. It is an upper middle-income economy that is nevertheless struggling due to low growth, high public debt, and exposure to external shocks.</p>
<p>In 2013, Jamaica launched an ambitious reform program to stabilize the economy, reduce debt, and fuel growth, gaining national and international support.</p>
<p>Public debt fell below 100% of GDP in 2018/19 and is expected to decline below 60% by 2025/26, in line with the provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility Law.  The rate of unemployment also fell to a historic low of 7.2% in October 2019, which is almost half the rate at the start of the reform program.</p>
<p> <br> Inequality in Jamaica is lower than in most countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region, but poverty at 19% in 2017 is still significant. Stronger and more resilient economic growth is needed to eliminate poverty and boost shared prosperity. Crime and violence levels remain high, emphasizing the need to address the issues of youth unemployment, education, and social cohesion.</p>
<p>Poverty is expected to decline further with rising per-capita GDP, lower unemployment, and strengthened safety nets. </p>

As the first former aid recipient to become a member of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2009,  Korea's gross national income (GNI) per capita increased rapidly from US$67 in the early 1950s to over <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://wits.worldbank.org/countrysnapshot/en/KOR"">US$30,000 in 2018</a>. </p>
<p>Korea is a key development<b> </b>partner of the World Bank Group and an important contributor (since 1977) to the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's fund that supports the world's poorest countries. Today Korea offers development experience that inspires many developing countries in sustainable development, provision of infrastructure and better services to improve the lives of the people, and transition to a dynamic knowledge economy. In 2015, Korea established a target to expand its official development assistance (ODA) to gross national income (GNI) ratio to 0.2% by 2020 and 0.3% by 2030 and has since been continuously increasing its ODA volume.<b></b></p>

<p>The Kyrgyz Republic is a land-locked, lower-middle-income country. It has rich endowments, including minerals, forests, arable land, and pastures, and has significant potential for the expansion of its agriculture sector, hydroelectricity production, and tourism industry.</p>
<p>The economy is vulnerable to external shocks owing to its reliance on one gold mine, Kumtor, which accounts for about 8 percent of GDP, and on worker remittances, equivalent to about 28 percent of GDP in 2019. To realize the country's potential, economic activities need to be diversified through increased private sector development and improved occupational skills and productivity.</p>
<p>The country has experienced instability since independence in 1991. Corruption and nepotism were major stress factors underlying revolts that deposed presidents in 2005 and 2010. A parliamentary constitution was adopted in 2010, making the Kyrgyz Republic the only Central Asian country in which the president is limited to a single term.</p>
<p>The country went through major turmoil following the parliamentary elections on October 4, 2020, which handed victory to establishment parties. The opposition denounced the results as fraudulent and began protests, seized government buildings, and freed jailed politicians, including ex-President Almazbek Atambayev. The election results have been annulled, and the prime minister has resigned. </p>
<p>The international community has expressed the hope that peace can be restored in the country and called on all political forces to act within the framework of the constitution.</p>

        <p>Lao PDR has made good development progress over the past twenty years, halving poverty, reducing malnutrition and improving education and health outcomes. However, there is room for further improvement. A child born in Laos today will only be half as productive as she could be if she enjoyed full health and education. Malnutrition continues to be a critical issue, with stunting (impaired growth and development from poor nutrition) affecting over 30 percent of children under five. The maternal mortality rate is also high, at 185 per 100,000 births (2017). While a Lao child goes to school for 10.8 years on average, she only receives the equivalent of 6.4 years of learning.</p>
<p>The 8<sup>th</sup> National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016–20 outlines the Lao government's program for further reducing poverty and boosting prosperity in the country. The plan proposes reforms that support greener, more inclusive growth, recognizing the limitations of a growth model that relies on natural resources and places increasing pressure on the environment. The green growth agenda aims to improve local livelihoods by diversifying income sources and encouraging the private sector to spur market development, for instance through sustainable forest management and nature-based tourism.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed challenges to this agenda. The pandemic has severely affected economic growth, which will decline to an estimated range of between -0.6 to -2.4 percent in 2020. The service sector, including travel and tourism has been hit hard by lockdown measures while remittances, a vital source of income for many families, have dried up. The unemployment rate rose to 25 percent in May 2020, from 16 percent at the end of 2019. Structural vulnerabilities have been exacerbated by COVID-19, leading to a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic situation. State revenues are declining and the fiscal deficit is projected to increase to between 7.6 and 8.9 percent, constraining the government's ability to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic. Public debt is expected to increase to between 69 and 74 percent in 2020, from around 60 percent in 2019. Foreign currency reserves are low, estimated to cover under one month of imports by the end of 2020. These factors make it increasingly difficult for Laos to meet its debt service obligations, which stand at around US$1.1 billion per year for 2020-23. </p>

        <p>Namibia is a largely desert ranchland with a long coastline on the South Atlantic, bordering South Africa, Botswana, and Angola. The country's natural mineral riches and a tiny population of about 2.5 million (2019) have made it an upper-middle-income country.  </p>
<p>Political stability and sound economic management have helped anchor poverty reduction. However, this has not yet been translated into job creation, and extreme socio-economic inequalities inherited from the years it was run under an apartheid system persist, despite generous public spending on social programs. </p>
<p><b>Economic Outlook </b></p>
<p>Namibia's economy has continued to face significant headwinds, with real output contracting by a further 1.4% in 2019. Having grown at an average 5.3% between 2010 and 2015, Namibia's economy entered a recession in 2016 and has since struggled to grow.  </p>
<p>COVID-19 (coronavirus) is set to have an unprecedented impact on Namibia's economy. With trade largely concentrated to a few countries and commodities, travel restrictions and lower demand will result in a contraction in exports. Gross domestic expenditure will also narrow as investment remains muted and the contraction in private consumption—witnessed since the growth slowdown began in 2016—continues. Economic lockdown will also impact tourism, retailers and service sectors, which may result in rising unemployment levels. Taken together, these developments are expected to result in a growth contraction of 4.8% in 2020. The growth outlook is subject to significant uncertainty given the unknown profile of the pandemic and likelihood of further restrictions in activity. Planned investments in mining could create further impetus in the medium term, but significant structural and policy reforms will be required for a broader base growth.  </p>
<p>The extreme poverty rate is expected to rise by nearly 2.7 percentage points in 2020, as the pandemic is threatening to widen gaps and increase the already extremely high inequality. The most affected are people living in urban areas, people with secondary education, and those employed in construction, manufacturing, private services, trade or transport sectors. </p>
<p><b>Development Challenges </b></p>
<p>Since its independence in 1990, Namibia has achieved notable progress in reducing poverty, halving the proportion of Namibians living below the national poverty line to 28.7% in 2009-10. In 2015-16, they further reduced that number to 17.4%.  </p>
<p>However, in part due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods, poverty rates are projected to increase in the near to medium terms, with the international extreme poverty rate projected to rise to 18.9% in 2022. Typically, female headed households, the less educated, larger families, children and the elderly, and laborers in subsistence farming, are particularly prone to poverty. </p>
<p>Severe drought conditions experienced in 2019 constrained agricultural output and led to a sharp decline in harvests. The reduction in precipitation also affected the broader economy through lower electricity and water generation, with repercussions on industrial production. These developments, along with lower diamond and mineral production due to reduced global demand and falling prices, in a context of much-needed fiscal consolidation, have created challenging conditions for growth. </p>
<p>Progress toward reducing inequality has been slow and as a result, Namibia is one of the most unequal countries in the world and this slows the pace of poverty reduction. The consumption Gini index declined from 64.6 in 1993/94 to 60.1 in 2004; to 59.5 in 2010, and further to 57.6 in 2015. </p>
<p>Namibia's relatively steady economic growth has, thus, not been enough to deal with the country's triple challenge of high poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Unemployment has remained stubbornly high at 34.0% of the working population in 2016 from 27.9% in 2014. Unemployment is even higher among women (38.3%) and the youth (43.4%).  </p>
<p>A small segment of poor Namibians benefits from employment income, while the majority rely instead on subsistence farming or social grants and other transfers. Slowing economic growth, owing partly to the ongoing fiscal consolidation and slow recovery of the regional trading partners, is expected to further constrain job creation. </p>

        <p><b>AT A GLANCE</b></p>
<p><b>In 2018, the World Bank came up with its <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/30224?show=full&amp;locale-attribute=es"">Country Partnership Framework</a> (CPF) covering the five-year period of FY2019-2023. Coincidentally, this came at a time of historic transformation in Nepal, as a new government took up office in February 2018. </b>The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006 ended a 10-year conflict that came at a significant cost of lives and foregone economic development. Since then, Nepal has gone through lengthy and complex transitions towards a new Constitution in 2015 that set in place a federal structure.  By the end of 2017, elections were successfully held at the federal, state, and local tiers. There is a newfound optimism for greater political stability, inclusion, good governance and sustainable growth. The new federal structure presents unprecedented opportunities for Nepal to reset its development storyline, as outlined in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).  At the same time, the shift to federalism poses new challenges and source of fragility, given the heightened popular aspirations and expectations. Key challenges include the need to clarify the functions and accountabilities of the federal, state, and local governments; deliver basic services and maintain infrastructure development; create a conducive environment for the private sector; and address governance weaknesses that may worsen in the early years of the new federal system.</p>
<p><b>COUNTRY CONTEXT</b></p>
<p><b>A new government, backed by a historic majority in Parliament, completed a year of office on February 15, 2019. </b>The government was<b> </b> preceded by elections for all three tiers (local, state and federal) of the state architecture defined by the new constitution, marking a protracted but successful conclusion of a political transition that began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in November 2006. State governments largely mirror the coalition at the center. At the sub-national level, funds, functions and functionaries hitherto managed by the central, district and village authorities are moving to the seven new states and 753 local governments for which new legislation, institutions and administrative procedures are being formalized as constitutionally prescribed.  Meanwhile, the central level authority is being streamlined with a focus on oversight.  These exercises at state restructuring are expected to result in improved outreach and service delivery but will likely take time before they become fully operational. </p>
<p>Significant adjustments need to be made to the government structure.  They include amending over 400 existing acts, restructuring the civil service at all levels, devolving fiscal management, and determining the division of funds, functions, and functionaries between various levels of government.</p>
<p>In contrast to the frequent changes in government that characterized Nepal's decade-long transition to federalism, the new government enjoys a historic super-majority in Parliament.  Along with new constitutional checks and a far fewer number of political parties, there is a much greater degree of optimism for stability in the coming days.  However, state restructuring on this scale is uncharted territory for Nepal and smoothening the transition from the previous unitary system to the new federal one will remain a daunting task. The new system, in principle, provides opportunities to decentralize development benefits and make service delivery more effective and accountable.  However, the risks of jurisdictional overlap between the three tiers of government, lack of clarity and coherence between policies and devolved powers, and duplication of efforts will remain high during the coming few years.  Key aspects of the new system require further definition and may continue to be contested by different population groups.</p>
<p><b>RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS</b></p>
<p><b>Economic growth slowed to 0.2 percent in FY20, mainly due to a national lockdown in response to the pandemic.</b> Service sector growth deteriorated to an 18-year low of 0.7 percent, as tourism arrivals stopped and domestic transport and wholesale and retail trade were disrupted. Industrial growth contracted, and capacity utilization fell from 80 to 46 percent because of shortages in production inputs and labor. Agricultural growth also decelerated sharply as market access and labor mobility became constrained. On the expenditure side, a contraction in private consumption and investment was marginally offset by positive contributions from government expenditures (on wages and COVID-19 related expenditures on health and social assistance) and net exports (driven by lower imports).</p>
<p><b>Average inflation reached 6.2 percent in FY20. Food price inflation spiked in early FY20 following an export ban on onions by India and remained elevated because of localized food shortages resulting from transport disruptions.</b> Prudential indicators of banking and financial institutions remained within<b> </b>regulatory targets: non-performing loans stood at 1.9 percent, capital adequacy at 14.2 percent, and liquidity at 27.9 percent. As a part of COVID-19 relief measures, the central bank relaxed regulatory requirements for banking and financial institutions, reduced the targeted interest rate, and increased the size of the refinancing facility. Despite these measures, deposit growth exceeded credit growth for the first time in five years: the credit to core capital and deposits ratio fell to 69.6 percent, well below the 80 percent regulatory limit.</p>
<p><b>Trade disruptions led to a 19.7 percent year-on-year drop in imports in FY20, significantly narrowing the current account deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP.</b> The sharp drop in imports outweighed both the contraction in exports - reflecting lower external demand for Nepali goods and a shutdown of tourist arrivals – and a 3.4 percent decline in remittance inflows due to lower outmigration and weak economic activity in migrant receiving countries. The current account deficit was mostly financed by external concessional loans. Foreign exchange reserves increased to $11.6 billion, equivalent to 12.7 months of imports.</p>
<p><b>The fiscal deficit increased in FY20 as trade restrictions caused a 5 percent contraction in tax revenue</b>. The fall in tax revenue was partly offset by low budget execution, with total expenditures remaining close to FY19 levels in nominal terms. As a result, the fiscal deficit widened only marginally, to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY20. Public debt increased to 38.3 percent of GDP in FY20, compared to 30.1 percent in FY19, reflecting the adverse growth dynamics.</p>
<p><b>COVID-19 related disruptions in livelihoods and the contraction in households' consumption are expected to have affected the poor, vulnerable, and households engaged in informal sector activities disproportionately.</b> Therefore, poverty is likely to increase in 2020. However, outdated poverty data (from 2010/11) makes projection-based estimates of poverty imprecise. The 2017/18 national labor market data also predates COVID-19. But, new data from an ongoing regional survey on the labor impacts of COVID- 19 will help track the evolution of job losses and recoveries in the last quarter of 2020.</p>

        <p><b>The COVID-19 pandemic hit Paraguay just as the country was embarking on a strong recovery path after growth had stalled in 2019. The global recession is likely to lead to a GDP decline of 1.2 percent in 2020.</b> Thereafter, growth is expected to return to 4 percent, as the world economy recovers.  This is subject to the downside risk of a slower than expected normalization of global markets. In turn, poverty is expected to increase in 2020, and income inequality to remain high.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak hits the Paraguay economy in a moment of economic recovery after growth had stalled in 2019. The economy was in a recession in the first half of 2019 (-3 percent year-on-year) due to weak performance of the main trading partners, especially Argentina, and adverse climatic conditions, but started to recover in the second half of the year (+3 percent year-on-year) as agriculture output rebounded along with favorable weather. Similarly, in the labor market, after the combined unemployment and underemployment rate reached 14.5 percent in the first half of 2019, it retracted to 12.9 percent in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>With a weaker economy and inflation close to the lower band of the target range (4 +/- 2 percent), the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) moved to a more accommodative stance, consistent with the inflation objective. During 2019, the BCP lowered the policy rate by a cumulative 125 bps to 4 percent. In February 2020, the inflation rate was 2.4 percent year-on-year. The flexible exchange rate regime continued to cushion external shocks. Meanwhile, foreign currency reserves remained at prudent levels, recovering after an initial decline at the onset of the Argentina crisis in 2018.</p>
<p>Given the recession in the first half of 2019, the authorities invoked the escape clause from the fiscal rule, capping the budget deficit (the Fiscal Responsibility Law, FRL, allows an increase of the deficit ceiling from 1.5 percent of GDP up to 3 percent GDP in times of crises). Therefore, the central government's budget was executed with a deficit of 2.9 percent GDP in 2019. While current expenditure grew by 8.2 percent, capital expenditure increased by 28.9 percent, although from a low base. The Parliament approved the 2020 Budget Law with a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, coherent with the FRL. </p>
<p>With the economic slowdown, poverty reduction continued, but at a slower pace: poverty rate fell from 24.2 percent in 2018 to 23.5 percent in 2019.  There remain 1.6 million people below the official poverty line.  Poverty reduction almost halted in urban areas (17.8 percent in 2018 compared to 17.5 percent in 2019) due to a decrease in labor incomes in commerce and manufacturing. Rural poverty dropped from 34.6 percent in 2018 to 33.4 percent, despite stable labor incomes in agriculture, which concentrates almost half (0.6 million) of mostly informal rural workers.  While an improvement on income inequality was recorded, the Gini index remains high 46.1.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop and the ongoing Dengue outbreak, the authorities have reacted swiftly to the outbreak of the COVID-19 in March 2020 to mitigate the impact on the economy and people. The Government implemented social distancing measures and population movement controls. The BCP reduced the policy interest rate by 175 bps to 2.25 percent, and temporarily relaxed provisioning rules not to penalize credit restructurings and prolongations. An anti-crisis fiscal package approved by Parliament includes additional spending on health and social protection programs, a subsidy for informal workers, support to small businesses, reallocation from non-priority spending lines, and a moratorium on fines for delayed tax payments. To finance it, the Government received authorization for an increase of the borrowing limit by US$ 1.6 billion and suspension of the FRL for up to four years.</p>
<p>Economic dynamics in 2020 is expected to be severely affected by the global recession accentuated by the reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. After the strong first quarter of 2020 due to “normalization” of agricultural harvest (as indicated by the high-frequency data for Jan-Feb), the economy will likely strongly contract in the next two quarters. The downturn will be driven by the decline in external demand and in domestic demand, especially in services, as a result of social distancing measures to slow the expansion of the pandemic. The economic package of the authorities, which is expected to increase fiscal deficit to 4 percent GDP, will soften the impact but would not fully compensate for it. In 2021-22, growth is expected to return to 4 percent, as the global economy recovers, and helped by consistent macroeconomic policies, anchored in the inflation targeting and a gradual return towards the FRL ceilings. Inflation is projected to return to the mid-point of the target range (4 percent) in 2021.</p>
<p>Going forward, poverty reduction is expected to stall, implying the need for a higher social protection support in the face of the expected global recession.  Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment and underemployment are expected to increase in commerce, services and construction. Labor incomes are expected to drop, especially for workers in the informal sector in the urban areas. The performance of family-based agriculture will be crucial for the protection of the most vulnerable in the rural areas. In addition, stronger labor income growth is needed in the services sector to improve livelihoods of those at the bottom of the income distribution in urban areas to attenuate the effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Paraguay has a solid macroeconomic framework based on fiscal rules, inflation targeting, and a flexible exchange rate regime. With the track-record of prudent macroeconomic policy over the last decade, low public debt and adequate FX reserves, the macroeconomic policies and crisis response measures are expected to be effective in absorbing a part of the COVID-19 shock. However, Paraguay is vulnerable to the domestic economic slowdown resulting from measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and its effects (social distancing, fiscal responses), as well as a steep reduction in economic activity in the global economy, and in neighboring countries. This will compound other, “pre-existing” economic risks and could disproportionally affect labor incomes of the 65 percent of informal workers in commerce and services. While the banking sector of Paraguay has a minimal exposure to Argentina, the real sector linkages through exports and remittances are stronger. Moreover, the concentration of exports in a few agricultural products continues to render growth and poverty vulnerable to fluctuations in agriculture commodity markets and to weather-related shocks (as showcased in 2019), affecting especially the most vulnerable population.</p>

<p>In May 2018, Russia set ambitious economic targets that include <i>accelerating the country's growth to roughly 3 percent and halving the poverty rate to 6.6 percent by 2024.</i> However, the new adverse economic environment has prompted Russia to adjust and postpone these targets. Notably, the goal of halving the baseline poverty rate has now been moved to 2030.</p>
<p>Russia's anti-coronavirus fiscal and financial support package consisted of a total of 4 percent of GDP. Prima facie, this 4 percent seems relatively small and less front-loaded compared to advanced economies. But if the figure is compared to countries with similar GDP per capita, such as Argentina, Bulgaria, and Kazakhstan, 4 percent is actually quite on par.</p>
<p>An initial assessment of the policy responses - changes to child allowances, maternity capital, and social security contributions to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) - has found that they will almost fully compensate for the increase in crisis-induced poverty.</p>

        <p>Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country with a GDP per capita of USD 3,852 (2019) and a total population of 21.8 million. Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, the economy grew at an average 5.3 percent during the period 2010-2019, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards reconstruction and growth; although growth slowed down in the last few years.</p>
<p>The economy is transitioning from a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing and services. Social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries. Economic growth has translated into shared prosperity with the national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1 percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical pockets; however, a relatively large share of the population subsists on slightly more than the poverty line.</p>
<p>Low fiscal revenues combined with largely non-discretionary expenditure in salary bill, transfers, and interest payments have constrained critical development spending on health, education and social protection, which is low compared to peer countries. Public debt levels are high while the overall debt portfolio indicate some important challenges.</p>
<p><b>Recent developments</b></p>
<p>After growing by 2.3 percent in 2019, the economy contracted by 1.6 percent y-o-y in the first quarter of 2020. The contraction, a first in 19 years, was driven by weak performances of construction, textile, mining and tea industries. Against this backdrop, the COVID-19 health crisis is believed to have impacted economic activity severely since the first quarter. High frequency indicators suggest that growth has faltered in the second quarter, as curfews impeded economic activity and global demand remained weak. Moreover, the closure of airports to tourists between April and September brought tourism activity to a standstill.</p>
<p>Weak demand has kept inflation in check thus far in 2020, creating room for policy support. Annual average inflation measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index was 4.1 percent in August 2020 despite high food inflation. This allowed the Central Bank to reduce policy rates by 250 basis points and the reserve ratio by 300 basis points over the first seven months of 2020. The Central Bank also introduced a refinancing facility and a credit guarantee scheme to encourage commercial banks to increase lending. Despite these measures, private credit growth remained subdued in the first half of 2020. Asset quality and earnings of the financial businesses deteriorated, reflecting the impact of decelerating loan recoveries and shrinking margins.</p>
<p>The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed in the first half of 2020. A reduction in imports due to severe import restrictions is likely to have offset reduced receipts from remittances, tourism, tea and textiles. Following heavy depreciation pressures in March, the LKR stabilized in the second quarter, as import controls helped the current account. Official reserves, estimated at USD 7.4 billion as of August, remain low relative to short-term external liabilities. Included in reserves is a swap facility of USD 400 million with the Reserve Bank of India and a loan of USD 500 million from the China Development Bank. The Central Bank also secured a repo facility with the New York Federal Reserve Bank for USD 1.0 billion as a contingency measure. A Eurobond of USD 1.0 billion is maturing in October 2020.</p>
<p>Fiscal accounts deteriorated in the first four months of 2020. Tax revenues fell short due to weak collection of value-added, income, and import taxes. The fiscal stimulus package implemented in November 2019 -which included a reduction of the VAT rate and an increase of the registration threshold, as well as import controls-, and slow growth contributed to the reduction in tax collection during this period. As a result, despite a moderation in public investment, the overall budget deficit increased by 24 percent in the first four months of 2020, year-on-year. Approximately half of the deficit was financed by Central Bank credit. The central government debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 90 percent (from 86.9 percent at end 2019), with more than half of the debt denominated in foreign currency. Citing limited fiscal buffers and external vulnerabilities, Fitch and S&amp;P downgraded the sovereign rating to B-.</p>
<p>The economic effects of COVID-19 will have significant welfare implications. Poverty measured using the $3.20 poverty line (in 2011 PPP) is estimated to have declined from 9.4 percent in 2018 to 8.9 percent in 2019. However, the COVID-19 crisis is believed to have triggered sharp jobs and earnings losses. Informal workers, about 70 percent of the workforce, are particularly vulnerable as they lack employment protection or paid leave. The apparel industry, which employs about half a million workers, has reportedly cut significant jobs. While agricultural production is expected to be largely undisrupted, weak external demand likely impacted export-oriented subsectors and wages. High food price inflation, which remains at double-digits, is disproportionately affecting the poor who spend a larger share of their budget on food.</p>

        <p>Ridding the world of poverty is not only morally right, but would make the world a better place for everyone. In pursuit of this goal, the United Kingdom and the World Bank Group work together to develop policies on a wide range of issues, such as conflict prevention, governance, health, and education -- trying to enable millions in the poorest countries to be immunized, gain access to roads and clean water, and become teachers, among other benefits. The Bank Group's expertise, knowledge, and ability to work across sectors and countries helps further the goals of human, economic, and sustainable development around the world.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom became a member of the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are/ibrd"">International Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> (IBRD) — the World Bank—in December 1945 and played a crucial role in helping found the Bretton Woods institutions (World Bank and International Monetary Fund). Today, the United Kingdom remains a major shareholder and an important and influential partner in global efforts to reduce poverty.</p>

        <p>Vietnam's development over the past 30 years has been remarkable. Economic and political reforms under Đổi Mới, launched in 1986, have spurred rapid economic growth, transforming what was then one of the world's poorest nations into a lower middle-income country. Between 2002 and 2018, GDP per capita increased by 2.7 times, reaching over US$2,700 in 2019, and more than 45 million people were lifted out of poverty. Poverty rates declined sharply from over 70 percent to below 6 percent (US$3.2/day PPP). The vast majority of Vietnam's remaining poor – 86 percent – are ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>In 2019, Vietnam's economy continued to show fundamental strength and resilience, supported by robust domestic demand and export-oriented manufacturing. Real  GDP grew by an estimated 7 percent in 2019, similar to 2018, one of the fastest growth rates in the region.</p>
<p>Given its deep integration with the global economy, the Vietnamese economy has been hit hard by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but has shown remarkable resilience. The initial health impact of the outbreak had not been as severe in Vietnam as in other countries due to proactive measures at the national and subnational levels. The macro-economic and fiscal framework remains resilient with an estimated GDP growth rate of 1.8 percent in the first half of 2020, projected to reach 2.8 percent for the year. Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world not to expect a recession, though its growth rate for this year is far less than the typical 6-7 percent pre-crisis projections. However, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is hard to predict given the uncertainty surrounding its magnitude and duration. Public financing requirements will increase as the result of lower revenue and higher spending due to the stimulus package launched  to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemics on households and businesses.</p>
<p>Thanks to its strong fundamentals, and assuming the relative control of the COVID-19 pandemic both in Vietnam and the world, the Vietnamese economy should rebound in 2021. COVID-19 has also shown the necessity for stronger reforms to help the economy recover in the medium term, such as improving business environment, promoting the digital economy, and enhancing public investment effectiveness and efficiency, which are some of the key agendas for Vietnam to consider stronger and faster reform actions.</p>
<p>Vietnam is experiencing rapid demographic and social change. Its population reached 96.5 million in 2019 (up from about 60 million in 1986) and is expected to expand to 120 million by 2050. Today, 70 percent of the population is under 35 years of age, with a life expectancy of 76 years, the highest among countries in the region at similar income levels. But the population is rapidly aging. And Vietnam's emerging middle class, currently accounting for 13 percent of the population, is expected to reach 26 percent by 2026.</p>
<p>Between 2010 and 2020, the Human Capital Index for Vietnam increases from 0.66 to 0.69. A Vietnamese child born today will be 69 percent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. Vietnam's HCI is the highest among middle-income countries, but there are some disparities within the country, especially for ethnic minorities. There is also a need to upgrade the skills of the workforce to create productive jobs at a large scale in the future.</p>
<p>Health outcomes have improved in tandem with rising living standards. From 1993 to 2017, the infant mortality rate decreased from 32.6 to 16.7 (per 1,000 live births). Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy increased from 70.5 to 76.3 years, and is the highest in the region for countries at a similar income level. Vietnam's universal health coverage index is at 73—higher than regional and global averages—with 87 percent of the population covered. However, the high and widening sex ratio at birth (115 in 2018) shows that fundamental gender discrimination persists. At the same time, Vietnam is one of the most rapidly aging countries and the 65+ age group is expected to increase 2.5 times by 2050.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the provision of basic services has improved significantly. Access of households to infrastructure services has increased dramatically. As of 2016, 99 percent of the population uses electricity as their main source of lighting, up from just 14 percent in 1993. Access to clean water in rural areas has also improved, up from 17 percent in 1993 to 70 percent in 2016, while that figure for urban areas is above 95 percent. However, in recent years, Vietnam's physical capital investment as a percentage of GDP has been among the lowest in the ASEAN region. This will create challenges for continued growth of modern infrastructure services required for the next phase of growth (Vietnam ranks 89th out of 137 countries for quality of its infrastructure).</p>
<p>Vietnam's rapid growth and industrialization have had detrimental impacts on the environment and natural assets.  Electricity consumption has tripled over the past decade, growing faster than output. Given the increasing reliance of fossil fuels, the power sector itself accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. There is an urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition. Over the past two decades, Vietnam has emerged as the fastest growing per-capita greenhouse gas emitters in the world – growing at about 5 percent annually. Demand for water continues to increase, while water productivity is low, about 12 percent of global benchmarks. Unsustainable exploitation of natural assets such as sand, fisheries, and timber could negatively affect prospects for long-term growth. Compounding the problem is the reality that much of Vietnam's population and economy is highly vulnerable to climate impacts.</p>
<p>Urbanization and strong economic and population growth are causing rapidly increasing waste management and pollution challenges. Waste generation in Vietnam is expected to double in less than 15 years. Linked to this is the issue of marine plastics. Ninety percent of global marine plastic pollution is estimated to come from just 10 in-land rivers, and the Mekong river is one of them. Vietnam is among the 10 countries worldwide that are most affected by air pollution. Water pollution has significant costs on productivity of key sectors and human health.</p>
<p>The government is working to lower the environmental footprint of the country's growth and effectively mitigate and adapt to climate change. Key strategies and plans to stimulate green growth and sustainable use of its natural assets are in place. The government is also implementing measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change and address extreme weather events and natural disasters by operationalizing its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).</p>
